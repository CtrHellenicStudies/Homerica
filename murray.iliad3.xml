<s n="1.1-1.7">The wrath sing,  goddess, of Peleus' son, Achilles, that destructive wrath which brought countless woes upon the Achaeans, and sent forth to Hades many valiant souls of heroes, and made them themselves spoil for dogs and every bird;

and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">2</note> on a staff of gold; 

and he implored all the Achaeans,
<milestone n="15" unit="line"/>but most of all the two sons of Atreus, the marshallers of the people:
</s><q>

<s n="check:1.17-1.19">Sons of Atreus, and other well-greaved Achaeans, to you may the gods who have homes upon <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> grant that you sack the city of Priam, and return safe to your homes;

out of reverence for the son of Zeus, Apollo who strikes from afar.

<p>

<s n="check:1.22-1.23">Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom,

</s><s n="check:1.24-1.25"> yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,<milestone n="25" unit="line"/> but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command:

<p><q>

<s n="check:1.26-1.28">Let me not find you, old man, by the hollow ships, either tarrying now or coming back later, lest your staff and the wreath of the god not protect you. 

</s><s n="check:1.29">Her I will not set free. 

</s><s n="check:1.29-1.31">Sooner shall old age come upon her <milestone n="30" unit="line"/> in our house, in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, far from her native land,

                    <p>

<s n="check:1.33">So he spoke, and the old man was seized with fear and obeyed his word.

 </s><s n="check:1.35-1.36"><milestone n="35" unit="line"/>and earnestly then, when he had gone apart, the old man prayed
to the lord Apollo, whom fair-haired Leto bore:

<s n="check:1.37-1.41">Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stand over <placeName key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName> and holy Cilla, and rule mightily over <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>, Sminthian god,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">1</note> if ever I roofed over a temple to your pleasing, or if ever I burned to you fat thigh-pieces of bulls and goats,

</s></q></p>
<p>

<s n="check:1.43-1.45">So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him.  

Down from the peaks of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> he strode, angered at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver.
<milestone n="45" unit="line"/>

</s><s n="check:1.46-1.47">The arrows rattled on the shoulders of the angry god as he moved,

</s><s n="check:1.50-1.52">The mules he assailed first and the swift dogs,
<milestone n="50" unit="line"/>but then on the men themselves he let fly his stinging shafts, and struck;

<p>

<s n="check:1.53-1.54">For nine days the missiles of the god ranged among the host, but on the tenth Achilles called the people to assembly,
</s><s n="check:1.55"> for the goddess, white-armed Hera, had put it in his heart,
<milestone n="55" unit="line"/>
</s><s n="check:1.56">since she pitied the Danaans, when she saw them dying.  

</s><s n="check:1.57-1.58">When they were assembled and gathered together, among them arose and spoke swift-footed Achilles:
</s><q>

<s n="check:1.59-1.61">Son of Atreus, now I think we shall return home, beaten back again, should we even escape death,
<milestone n="60" unit="line"/>if war and pestilence alike are to ravage the Achaeans.  

</s><s n="check:1.62-1.67">But come, let us ask some seer or priest, or some reader of dreams—for a dream too is from Zeus—who might say why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, whether he finds fault with a vow or a hecatomb;
<milestone n="65" unit="line"/>in hope that he may accept the savour of lambs and unblemished goats, and be willing to ward off the pestilence from us.
</s></q></p>

                    <p>

<s n="check:1.68">When he had thus spoken he sat down, 

</s><s n="check:1.68-1.72">and among them arose Calchas son of Thestor, far the best of bird-diviners, who knew the things that were, and that were to be, and that had been before,
<milestone n="70" unit="line"/>and who had guided the ships of the Achaeans to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> by his own prophetic powers which Phoebus Apollo had bestowed upon him.  

</s><s n="check:1.73">He with good intent addressed the gathering, and spoke among them:
</s><q>

<s n="check:1.74-1.75">Achilles, dear to Zeus, you bid me declare the wrath of Apollo, the lord who strikes from afar.
<milestone n="75" unit="line"/>

</s><s n="check:1.76">Therefore I will speak; 

</s><s n="check:1.76-1.77">but take thought and swear that you will readily defend me with word and with might of hand; 

</s><s n="check:1.78-1.79">for I think I shall anger a man who rules mightily over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey.  

</s><s n="check:1.80">For mightier is a king, when he is angry at a lesser man.
<milestone n="80" unit="line"/>

</s><s n="check:1.81-1.83">Even if he swallows down his wrath for that day, yet afterwards he cherishes resentment in his heart till he brings it to fulfillment.  

</s><s n="check:1.83">Say then, if you will keep me safe.
</s></q></p>
<p>

<s n="check:1.84">In answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilles:
</s><q>

<s n="check:1.85">Take heart, and speak out whatever oracle you know;
<milestone n="85" unit="line"/>

</s><s n="check:1.86-1.91">for by Apollo, dear to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas, pray when you reveal oracles to the Danaans, no one, while I live and have sight on the earth, shall lay heavy hands on you beside the hollow ships, no one of the whole host of the Danaans,
<milestone n="90" unit="line"/>not even if you name Agamemnon, who now claims to be far the best of the Achaeans.
</s></q></p>

                    <p>

<s n="check:1.92">Then the blameless seer took heart, and spoke:
</s><q>

<s n="check:1.93-1.96">It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault, nor because of a hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured, and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom.
<milestone n="95" unit="line"/>

For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them. 

</s><s n="check:1.97-1.100">He will not drive off from the Danaans the loathsome pestilence, until we give back to her dear father the bright-eyed maiden, unbought, unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb to <placeName key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName>. 

</s><s n="1.100"><milestone n="100" unit="line"/>Then we might appease and persuade him.
</s></q></p>
<p>


<s n="check:1.101">When he had thus spoken he sat down,

</s><s n="check:1.101-1.103"> and among them arose the warrior, son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, deeply troubled. 

</s><s n="check:1.103-1.104">With rage his black heart was wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire.  

</s><s n="check:1.105">To Calchas first of all he spoke, and his look threatened evil:
<milestone n="105" unit="line"/></s></p>
<p><q>

<s n="check:1.106">Prophet of evil, never yet have you spoken to me a pleasant thing; 

</s><s n="check:1.107-1.108">ever is evil dear to your heart to prophesy, but a word of good you have never yet spoken, nor brought to pass.  

</s><s n="check:1.109-1.113">And now among the Danaans you claim in prophecy that for this reason the god who strikes from afar brings woes upon them,
<milestone n="110" unit="line"/>that I would not accept the glorious ransom for the girl, the daughter of Chryses, since I much prefer to keep her in my home.  

</s><s n="check:1.113-1.115">For certainly I prefer her to Clytemnestra, my wedded wife, since she is not inferior to her, either in form or in stature, or in mind, or in  any handiwork.
<milestone n="115" unit="line"/>

</s><s n="check:1.116">Yet even so will I give her back, if that is better; 

</s><s n="check:1.117">I would rather the people be safe than perish.  

</s><s n="check:1.118-1.119">But provide me with a prize of honour forthwith, lest I alone of the Argives be without one, since that would not be proper.

Let us now drag a black ship to the shining sea, and quickly gather suitable rowers into it, and place on board a hecatomb, and embark on it the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses herself.
