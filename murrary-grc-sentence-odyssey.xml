<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.1-1.2"/>Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered so very much after he had sacked the sacred citadel of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.3-1.5"/>Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea,

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
seeking after his own life and the homecoming of his comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.6"/>Yet even so he did not save his comrades, though he struggled hard,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.7-1.9"/> for through their own blind folly they perished—fools, who devoured the cattle of Helios Hyperion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.9"/> And so he took from them the day of their homecoming.

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.10"/>Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, beginning where you will, tell also to us.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.11-1.12"/>Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, having escaped from both war and sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.13-1.15"/> Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his return and for his wife, the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess,

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
kept back in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.16-1.19"/>But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, not even there had he made his escape from toils, even among his own people. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.19-1.20"/>The gods felt pity, all 

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>
except Poseidon; but he continued to rage unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until he reached his own land.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.20-1.21"/>Poseidon had, however, gone among the far-off Ethiopians—the Ethiopians who dwell split in two, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises,

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams, and there he was taking his pleasure, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.26"/>Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of blameless Aegisthus,

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>
whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son, had slain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.31"/>Remembering him he spoke among the immortals:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.32"/>I can't believe, how ridiculously ready mortals are to blame the gods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.33-1.39"/>It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained.

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So even now Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and kkilled him on his homecoming, although well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing that we told him beforehand, having sent Hermes, the keen-sighted Argeiphontes,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> that he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife;

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood and longs for his own land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.40-1.41"/>So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he did not persuade the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the full price of all.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.42-1.43"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.43"/>Athena, answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.45-1.46"/>Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, aye, verily that man lies low in a destruction that is his due; so, too, may any other also be destroyed who does such deeds. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.47"/>But my heart is torn for wise Odysseus, hapless man, who far from his friends has long been suffering woes

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>
in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea. 'Tis a wooded isle, and therein dwells a goddess, daughter of Atlas of baneful mind, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself holds the tall pillars which keep earth and heaven apart.

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.55-1.57"/>His daughter it is that keeps back that wretched, sorrowing man; and ever with soft and wheedling words she beguiles him that he may forget <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.57-1.59"/>But Odysseus, in his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land, yearns to die. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.59-1.60"/>Yet thy

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>
heart doth not regard it, Olympian. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.60-1.62"/>Did not Odysseus beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice without stint in the broad land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.62"/>Wherefore then didst thou conceive such wrath<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> against him, O Zeus?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.63"/>Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.64"/>My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth?

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.65-1.67"/>How should I, then, forget godlike Odysseus, who is beyond all mortals in wisdom, and beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.68-1.71"/>Nay, it is Poseidon, the earth-enfolder, who is ever filled with stubborn wrath because of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus blinded of his eye—

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
even the godlike Polyphemus, whose might is greatest among all the Cyclopes; and the nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys who rules over the unresting<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> sea; for in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.71-1.73"/>From that time forth Poseidon, the earth-shaker,

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
does not indeed slay Odysseus, but makes him a wanderer from his native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.76-1.77"/>But come, let us who are here all take thought of his return, that he may come home; and Poseidon will let go his anger, for he will in no wise be able, against all the immortal gods and in their despite, to contend alone.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.80"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.81-1.87"/>Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, if indeed this is now well pleasing to the blessed gods, that the wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us send forth Hermes, the messenger, Argeiphontes,

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>
to the isle Ogygia, that with all speed he may declare to the fair-tressed nymph our fixed resolve, even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, that he may come home. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.88-1.92"/>But, as for me, I will go to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that I may the more arouse his son, and set courage in his heart

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
to call to an assembly the long-haired Achaeans, and speak out his word to all the wooers, who are ever slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> kine of shambling gait. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.93-1.95"/>And I will guide him to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, to seek tidings of the return of his dear father, if haply he may hear of it,

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>
that good report may be his among men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.95-1.97"/>So she spoke, and bound beneath her feet her beautiful sandals, immortal,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> golden, which were wont to bear her both over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.98-1.101"/>And she took her mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze,

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
heavy and huge and strong, wherewith she vanquishes the ranks of men—of warriors, with whom she is wroth, she, the daughter of the mighty sire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.102-1.104"/>Then she went darting down from the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and took her stand in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> at the outer gate of Odysseus, on the threshold of the court. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.104-1.105"/>In her hand she held the spear of bronze,

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
and she was in the likeness of a stranger, Mentes, the leader of the Taphians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.106"/>There she found the proud wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.106-1.108"/>They were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors, sitting on the hides of oxen which they themselves had slain; and of the heralds<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and busy squires,

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>
some were mixing wine and water for them in bowls, others again were washing the tables with porous sponges and setting them forth, while still others were portioning out meats in abundance.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.113-1.117"/>Her the godlike Telemachus was far the first to see, for he was sitting among the wooers, sad at heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
seeing in thought his noble father, should he perchance come from somewhere and make a scattering of the wooers in the palace, and himself win honor and rule over his own house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.118"/>As he thought of these things, sitting among the wooers, he beheld Athena, and he went straight to the outer door; for in his heart he counted it shame

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
that a stranger should stand long at the gates. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.120-1.122"/>So, drawing near, he clasped her right hand, and took from her the spear of bronze; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.123"/>Hail, stranger; in our house thou shalt find entertainment and then, when thou hast tasted food, thou shalt tell of what thou hast need.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:1.125-1.177">
                        <p>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.125"/>So saying, he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.126-1.131"/>And when they were within the lofty house, he bore the spear and set it against a tall pillar in a polished spear-rack, where were set many spears besides, even those of Odysseus of the steadfast heart.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.131"/>Athena herself he led and seated on a chair, spreading a linen cloth beneath—a beautiful chair, richly-wrought,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and below was a footstool for the feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.132-1.135"/>Beside it he placed for himself an inlaid seat, apart from the others, the wooers, lest the stranger, vexed by their din, should loathe the meal, seeing that he was in the company of overweening men;

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
and also that he might ask him about his father that was gone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.136-1.138"/>Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.138"/>And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread,

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.141-1.142"/>And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden goblets, while a herald ever walked to and fro pouring them wine.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.143"/>Then in came the proud wooers, and thereafter

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
sat them down in rows on chairs and high seats. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.149"/>Heralds poured water over their hands, and maid-servants heaped by them bread in baskets, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink; and they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.150-1.152"/>Now after the wooers had put from them the desire of food and drink, their hearts turned to other things, to song and to dance; for these things are the crown of a feast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.152"/>And a herald put the beautiful lyre in the hands of Phemius, who sang perforce among the wooers;

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
and he struck the chords in prelude<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> to his sweet lay.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.155"/>But Telemachus spoke to flashing-eyed Athena, holding his head close, that the others might not hear: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.156-1.157"/>Dear stranger, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.158"/>These men care for things like these, the lyre and song,

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
full easily, seeing that without atonement they devour the livelihood of another, of a man whose white bones, it may be, rot in the rain as they lie upon the mainland, or the wave rolls them in the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.163-1.165"/>Were they to see him returned to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, they would all pray to be swifter of foot,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
rather than richer in gold and in raiment. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.166-1.168"/>But now he has thus perished by an evil doom, nor for us is there any comfort, no, not though any one of men upon the earth should say that he will come; gone is the day of his returning. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.168"/>But come, tell me this, and declare it truly.

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.170"/>Who art thou among men, and from whence? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.170"/>Where is thy city and where thy parents? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.171"/>On what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.171-1.172"/>Who did they declare themselves to be? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.172"/>For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.173"/>And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well,

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
whether this is thy first coming hither, or whether thou art indeed a friend of my father's house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.178"/>For many were the men who came to our house as strangers, since he, too, had gone to and fro<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> among men.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.179"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Therefore of a truth will I frankly tell thee all.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.180-1.181"/>I declare that I am Mentes, the son of wise Anchialus, and I am lord over the oar-loving Taphians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.182-1.184"/>And now have I put in here, as thou seest, with ship and crew, while sailing over the wine-dark sea to men of strange speech, on my way to Temese for copper; and I bear with me shining iron.

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.185-1.186"/>My ship lies yonder beside the fields away from the city, in the harbor of Rheithron, under woody Neion. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.187-1.193"/>Friends of one another do we declare ourselves to be, even as our fathers were, friends from of old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Nay, if thou wilt, go and ask the old warrior Laertes, who, they say,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
comes no more to the city, but afar in the fields suffers woes attended by an aged woman as his handmaid, who sets before him food and drink, after weariness has laid hold of his limbs, as he creeps along the slope of his vineyard plot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.194"/>And now am I come, for of a truth men said that he,

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
thy father, was among his people; but lo, the gods are thwarting him of his return. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.195"/>For not yet has goodly Odysseus perished on the earth, but still, I ween, he lives and is held back on the broad sea in a sea-girt isle, and cruel men keep him, a savage folk, that constrain him, haply sore against his will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.200-1.202"/>Nay, I will now prophesy to thee, as the immortals put it in my heart, and as I think it shall be brought to pass, though I am in no wise a soothsayer, nor one versed in the signs of birds.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.215-1.216"/>My mother says that I am his child; but I know not, for never yet did any man of himself know his own parentage.

they say that I am sprung, since thou askest me of this.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.221"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.230"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.231-1.233"/>Stranger, since indeed thou dost ask and question me of this, our house once bade fair to be rich and honorable, so long as that man was still among his people. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.234-1.238"/>But now the gods have willed otherwise in their evil devising,

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
seeing that they have caused him to pass from sight as they have no other man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.239-1.240"/>For I should not so grieve for his death, if he had been slain among his comrades in the land of the Trojans, or had died in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb,

and for his son, too, he would have won great glory in days to come. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.241"/>But as it is, the spirits of the storm<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> have swept him away and left no tidings: he is gone out of sight, out of hearing, and for me he has left anguish and weeping; nor do I in any wise mourn and wail for him alone, seeing that the gods have brought upon me other sore troubles.

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.245-1.248"/>For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.249-1.250"/>And she neither refuses the hateful marriage,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.255-1.263"/>Would that he might come now and take his stand at the outer gate of the house, with helmet and shield and two spears, such a man as he was when I first saw him in our house drinking and making merry, on his way back from Ephyre, from the house of Ilus, son of Mermerus.

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.263-1.265"/>For thither, too, went Odysseus in his swift ship in search of a deadly drug, that he might have wherewith to smear his bronze-tipped arrows; yet Ilus gave it not to him, for he stood in awe of the gods that are forever; but my father gave it, for he held him strangely dear.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.265-1.266"/>Would, I say, that in such strength Odysseus might come amongst the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing.

then return to thy dear native land and heap up a mound for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many as is due, and give thy mother to a husband.

how thou mayest slay the wooers in thy halls whether by guile or openly; for it beseems thee not to practise childish ways, since thou art no longer of such an age.

the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew his glorious father? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.301-1.302"/>Thou too, my friend, for I see that thou art comely and tall, be thou valiant, that many an one of men yet to be born may praise thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.303-1.304"/>But now I will go down to my swift ship and my comrades, who, methinks, are chafing much at waiting for me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.305"/>For thyself, give heed and have regard to my words.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.306"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.309-1.313"/>But come now, tarry, eager though thou art to be gone,

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
in order that when thou hast bathed and satisfied thy heart to the full, thou mayest go to thy ship glad in spirit, and bearing a gift costly and very beautiful, which shall be to thee an heirloom from me, even such a gift as dear friends give to friends.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.314"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:

and let them drink their wine in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.347-1.349"/>It is not minstrels that are to blame, but Zeus, I ween, is to blame, who gives to men that live by toil,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> to each one as he will.

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.350"/>With this man no one can be wroth if he sings of the evil doom of the Danaans; for men praise that song the most which comes the newest to their ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.380"/>Without atonement, then, should ye perish within my halls.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.383"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.388"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.390"/>Even this should I be glad to accept from the hand of Zeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.391"/>Thinkest thou indeed that this is the worst fate among men? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.392"/>Nay, it is no bad thing to be a king. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.392-1.393"/>Straightway one's house grows rich and oneself is held in greater honor. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.394-1.396"/>However, there are other kings of the Achaeans

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:1.425-1.427"/>But Telemachus, where his chamber was built in the beautiful court, high, in a place of wide outlook, thither went to his bed, pondering many things in mind; and with him, bearing blazing torches, went true-hearted Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose the dear son of Odysseus and put on his clothing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>About his shoulder he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
and went forth from his chamber like a god to look upon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.6-2.7"/>Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.8"/>And the heralds made the summons, and the Achaeans assembled full quickly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.9-2.11"/>Now when they were assembled and met together,

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.12"/>Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly, holding in his hand a spear of bronze—not alone, for along with him two swift hounds followed; and wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.13"/>But he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave place.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.15-2.16"/>Then among them the lord Aegyptius was the first to speak, a man bowed with age and wise with wisdom untold. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.17-2.19"/>Now he spoke, because his dear son had gone in the hollow ships to Ilius, famed for its horses, in the company of godlike Odysseus, even the warrior Antiphus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.19-2.20"/>But him the savage <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had slain

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>
in his hollow cave, and made of him his latest meal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.21-2.22"/>Three others there were; one, Eurynomus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept their father's farm. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.23"/>Yet, even so, he could not forget that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.25"/>Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.26-2.27"/>Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.28"/>And now who has called us together? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.28-2.29"/>On whom has such need come either of the young men or of those who are older?

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.30-2.31"/>Has he heard some tidings of the army's return,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> which he might tell us plainly, seeing that he has first learned of it himself? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.32"/>Or is there some other public matter on which he is to speak and address us? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.33"/>A good man he seems in my eyes, a blessed man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.33-2.34"/>May Zeus fulfil unto him himself some good, even whatsoever he desires in his heart.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.35-2.37"/>So he spoke, and the dear son of Odysseus rejoiced at the word of omen; nor did he thereafter remain seated, but was fain to speak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.37-2.38"/>So he took his stand in the midst of the assembly, and the staff was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor, wise in counsel.</p>

                        <p>Then he spoke, addressing first the old man:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.40-2.41"/>Old man, not far off, as thou shalt soon learn thyself, is that man who has called the host together—even I; for on me above all others has sorrow come. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.41"/>I have neither heard any tidings of the army's return, which I might tell you plainly, seeing that I had first learned of it myself, nor is there any other public matter on which I am to speak and address you.

<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.46-2.47"/>Nay, it is mine own need, for that evil has fallen upon my house in two-fold wise. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.48-2.49"/>First, I have lost my noble sire who was once king among you here, and was gentle as a father; and now there is come an evil yet greater far, which will presently altogether destroy my house and ruin all my livelihood.

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.50-2.54"/>My mother have wooers beset against her will, the sons of those men who are here the noblest. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>They shrink from going to the house of her father, Icarius, that he may himself exact the bride-gifts for his daughter, and give her to whom he will, even to him who meets his favour,

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
but thronging our house day after day they slay our oxen and sheep and fat goats, and keep revel, and drink the sparkling wine recklessly; and havoc is made of all this wealth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.55-2.58"/>For there is no man here, such as Odysseus was, to ward off ruin from the house.

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.60"/>As for me, I am no-wise such as he to ward it off. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.60-2.61"/>Nay verily, even if I try I shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of valor. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.62"/>Yet truly I would defend myself, if I had but the power; for now deeds past all enduring have been wrought, and past all that is seemly has my house been destroyed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.63-2.64"/>Take shame upon yourselves,

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>
and have regard to your neighbors who dwell roundabout, and fear the wrath of the gods, lest haply they turn against you in anger at your evil deeds.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.66-2.67"/>I pray you by Olympian Zeus, and by Themis who looses and gathers the assemblies of men,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
forbear, my friends,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and leave me alone to pine in bitter grief—unless indeed my father, goodly Odysseus, despitefully wrought the well-greaved Achaeans woe, in requital whereof ye work me woe despitefully by urging these men on. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.70-2.74"/>For me it were better

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
that ye should yourselves eat up my treasures and my flocks. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.76"/>If ye were to devour them, recompense would haply be made some day; for just so long should we go up and down the city, pressing our suit and asking back our goods, until all was given back. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.77-2.78"/>But now past cure are the woes ye put upon my heart.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.80-2.81"/>Thus he spoke in wrath, and dashed the staff down upon the ground, bursting into tears; and pity fell upon all the people. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.81"/>Then all the others kept silent, and no man had the heart to answer Telemachus with angry words.</p>

                        <p>Antinous alone answered him, and said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>
<q><p>Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said, putting us to shame, and wouldest fain fasten reproach upon us! Nay, I tell thee, it is not the Achaean wooers who are anywise at fault, but thine own mother, for she is crafty above all women. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.85-2.86"/>For it is now the third year and the fourth will soon pass,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
since she has been deceiving the hearts of the Achaeans in their breasts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.91-2.92"/>To all she offers hopes, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.93"/>And she devised in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.95"/>Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes, against the time when

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
the fell fate of grievous<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> death shall strike him down; lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he, who had won great possessions, were to lie without a shroud.></q></p>
    <p>So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.102"/>Then day by day she would weave at the great web,

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.106"/>Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came as the seasons rolled on, even then one of her women who knew all told us, and we caught her unravelling the splendid web.

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.110"/>So she finished it against her will, perforce. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.111-2.112"/>Therefore to thee the wooers make answer thus, that thou mayest thyself know it in thine heart, and that all the Achaeans may know. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.113-2.114"/>Send away thy mother, and command her to wed whomsoever her father bids, and whoso is pleasing to her.

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.115-2.120"/>But if she shall continue long time to vex the sons of the Achaeans, mindful in her heart of this, that Athena has endowed her above other women with knowledge of fair handiwork and an understanding heart, and wiles, such as we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old knew, of those who long ago were fair-tressed Achaean women—

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.121-2.122"/>Tyro and Alcmene and Mycene of the fair crown—of whom not one was like Penelope in shrewd device; yet this at least she devised not aright. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.122"/>For so long shall men devour thy livelihood and thy possessions, even as long as she shall keep the counsel which

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
the gods now put in her heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.125-2.126"/>Great fame she brings on herself, but on thee regret for thy much substance. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.127-2.128"/>For us, we will go neither to our lands nor else whither, until she marries that one of the Achaeans whom she will.</p></q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.129"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.130-2.131"/>Antinous, in no wise may I thrust forth from the house against her will her that bore me and reared me; and, as for my father, he is in some other land, whether he be alive or dead. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.131-2.132"/>An evil thing it were for me to pay back a great price to Icarius, as I must, if of my own will I send my mother away. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.132-2.133"/>For from her father's hand shall I suffer evil, and heaven

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
will send other ills besides, for my mother as she leaves the house will invoke the dread Avengers; and I shall have blame, too, from men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.136-2.137"/>Therefore will I never speak this word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.137"/>And for you, if your own heart is wroth here at, get you forth from my halls and prepare you other feasts,

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
eating your own substance and changing from house to house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.141-2.143"/>But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.143-2.144"/>But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.145"/>Without atonement then should ye perish within my halls.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.146-2.147"/>So spoke Telemachus, and in answer Zeus, whose voice is borne afar,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> sent forth two eagles, flying from on high, from a mountain peak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.148-2.149"/>For a time they flew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with wings outspread;

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>
but when they reached the middle of the many-voiced assembly, then they wheeled about, flapping their wings rapidly, and down on the heads of all they looked, and death was in their glare. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.150-2.152"/>Then they tore with their talons one another's cheeks and necks on either side, and darted away to the right across the houses and the city of the men.

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.155"/>But they were seized with wonder at the birds when their eyes beheld them, and pondered in their hearts on what was to come to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.156"/>Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and in uttering words of fate.

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.160"/>He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.161"/>Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say; and to the wooers especially do I declare and announce these things, since on them a great woe is rolling. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.162"/>For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends, but even now, methinks,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
he is near, and is sowing death and fate for these men, one and all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.166-2.167"/>Aye, and to many others of us also who dwell in clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> will he be a bane. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.167-2.168"/>But long ere that let us take thought how we may make an end of this—or rather let them of themselves make an end, for this is straightway the better course for them.

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.170"/>Not as one untried do I prophesy, but with sure knowledge. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.171-2.173"/>For unto Odysseus I declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told him, when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> and with them went Odysseus of many wiles. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.174-2.176"/>I declared that after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades he would come home in the twentieth year

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.176"/>Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.177"/>Old man, up now, get thee home and prophesy to thy children, lest haply in days to come they suffer ill.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.180"/>In this matter I am better far than thou to prophesy. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.181-2.182"/>Many birds there are that fare to and fro under the rays of the sun, and not all are fateful. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.182-2.184"/>As for Odysseus, he has perished far away, as I would that thou hadst likewise perished with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.184-2.186"/>Then wouldst thou not prate so much in thy reading of signs,

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
or be urging Telemachus on in his wrath, hoping for some gift for thy house, if haply he shall give it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.187"/>But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.188-2.191"/>If thou, wise in the wisdom of old, shalt beguile with thy talk a younger man, and set him on to be wroth,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
for him in the first place it shall be the more grievous, and he will in no case be able to do aught because of these men here, and on thee, old man, will we lay a fine which it will grieve thy soul to pay, and bitter shall be thy sorrow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.192-2.193"/>And to Telemachus I myself, here among all, will offer this counsel.

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.195"/>His mother let him bid to go back to the house of her father, and they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready the gifts full many,—aye, all that should follow after a well-loved daughter. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.196-2.197"/>For ere that, methinks, the sons of the Achaeans will not cease from their grievous wooing, since in any case we fear no man,—

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
no, not Telemachus for all his many words,—nor do we reck of any soothsaying which thou, old man, mayest declare; it will fail of fulfillment, and thou shalt be hated the more. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.203-2.205"/>Aye, and his possessions shall be devoured in evil wise, nor shall requital ever be made, so long as she shall put off the Achaeans

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
in the matter of her marriage. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.205-2.207"/>And we on our part waiting here day after day are rivals by reason of her excellence, and go not after other women, whom each one might fitly wed.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.208"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.209-2.210"/>Eurymachus and all ye other lordly wooers,

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
in this matter I entreat you no longer nor speak thereof, for now the gods know it, and all the Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.211"/>But come, give me a swift ship and twenty comrades who will accomplish my journey for me to and fro. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.212-2.213"/>For I shall go to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
to seek tidings of the return of my father that has long been gone, if haply any mortal man may tell me, or I may hear a voice from Zeus, which oftenest brings tidings to men.

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.220-2.223"/>If so be I shall hear that my father is alive and coming home, then verily, though I am sore afflicted, I could endure for yet a year. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.224-2.227"/>But if I shall hear that he is dead and gone, then I will return to my dear native land and heap up a mound for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many, as is due, and give my mother to a husband.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So saying he sat down, and among them rose

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.228"/>Mentor, who was a comrade of noble Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.229"/>To him, on departing with his ships, Odysseus had given all his house in charge, that it should obey the old man and that he should keep all things safe. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.230-2.232"/>Never henceforth let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed righteousness in his heart, but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness, seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was; yet gentle was he as a father.

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.235-2.236"/>But of a truth I begrudge not the proud wooers that they work deeds of violence in the evil contrivings of their minds, for it is at the hazard of their own lives that they violently devour the house of Odysseus, who, they say, will no more return. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.237-2.238"/>Nay, rather it is with the rest of the folk that I am wroth, that ye all

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
sit thus in silence, and utter no word of rebuke to make the wooers cease, though ye are many and they but few.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.242"/>Then Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.243-2.244"/>Mentor, thou mischief-maker,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> thou wanderer in thy wits, what hast thou said, bidding men make us cease? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.244-2.245"/>Nay, it were a hard thing

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
to fight about a feast with men that moreover outnumber you. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.246-2.251"/>For if Ithacan Odysseus himself were to come and be eager at heart to drive out from his hall the lordly wooers who are feasting in his house, then should his wife have no joy

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
at his coming, though sorely she longed for him, but right here would he meet a shameful death, if he fought with men that outnumbered him.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.251"/>Thou hast not spoken aright. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.252-2.254"/>But come now, ye people, scatter, each one of you to his own lands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>As for this fellow, Mentor and Halitherses will speed his journey, for they are friends of his father's house from of old.

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.255-2.256"/>But methinks he will long abide here and get his tidings in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and never accomplish this journey.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.257"/>So he spoke, and hastily broke up the assembly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.258-2.259"/>They then scattered, each one to his own house; and the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.262-2.265"/>Hear me, thou who didst come yesterday as a god to our house, and didst bid me go in a ship over the misty deep to seek tidings of the return of my father, that has long been gone.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.265-2.266"/>Lo, all this the Achaeans hinder, but the wooers most of all in their evil insolence.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.267-2.269"/>So he spoke in prayer, and Athena drew near to him in the likeness of Mentor, both in form and invoice; and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.270-2.272"/>Telemachus, neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, if aught of thy father's goodly spirit has been instilled into thee, such a man was he to fulfil both deed and word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.273"/>So then shall this journey of thine be neither vain nor unfulfilled. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.274-2.275"/>But if thou art not the son of him and of Penelope,

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
then I have no hope that thou wilt accomplish thy desire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.276-2.277"/>Few sons indeed are like their fathers; most are worse, few better than their fathers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.278-2.280"/>But since neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, nor has the wisdom of Odysseus wholly failed thee,

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
there is therefore hope that thou wilt accomplish this work. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.281-2.283"/>Now then let be the will and counsel of the wooers—fools, for they are in no wise either prudent or just, nor do they know aught of death or black fate, which verily is near at hand for them, that they shall all perish in a day.

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.285"/>But for thyself, the journey on which thy heart is set shall not be long delayed, so true a friend of thy father's house am I, who will equip for thee a swift ship, and myself go with thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.286-2.287"/>But go thou now to the house and join the company of the wooers; make ready stores, and bestow all in vessels—

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>
wine in jars, and barley meal, the marrow of men, in stout skins;—but I, going through the town, will quickly gather comrades that go willingly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.291-2.292"/>And ships there are full many in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, both new and old; of these will I choose out for thee the one that is best,

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
and quickly will we make her ready and launch her on the broad deep.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.296"/>So spoke Athena, daughter of Zeus, nor did Telemachus tarry long after he had heard the voice of the goddess, but went his way to the house, his heart heavy within him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.296-2.297"/>He found there the proud wooers in the halls,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
flaying goats and singeing swine in the court. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.301-2.302"/>And Antinous with a laugh came straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.303-2.305"/>Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, let no more any evil deed or word be in thy heart.

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.306-2.308"/>Nay, I bid thee, eat and drink even as before. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.309"/>All these things the Achaeans will surely provide for thee—the ship and chosen oarsmen—that with speed thou mayest go to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to seek for tidings of thy noble father.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.310-2.311"/>Antinous, in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry with an easy mind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.312-2.313"/>Is it not enough, ye wooers, that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions of mine, while I was still a child? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.314-2.317"/>But now that I am grown,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>
and gain knowledge by hearing the words of others, yea and my spirit waxes within me, I will try how I may hurl forth upon your evil fates, either going to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> or here in this land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.318-2.319"/>For go I will, nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak, though I voyage in another's ship, since I may not be master of ship or oarsmen.

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.320"/>So, I ween, it seemed to you to be more to your profit.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.321-2.322"/>He spoke, and snatched his hand from the hand of Antinous without more ado, and the wooers were busy with the feast throughout the hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.322"/>They mocked and jeered at him in their talk; and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.325"/>Aye, verily Telemachus is planning our murder. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.326-2.327"/>He will bring men to aid him from sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> or even from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, so terribly is he set upon it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.328-2.330"/>Or he means to go to Ephyre, that rich land, to bring from thence deadly drugs,

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>
that he may cast them in the wine-bowl, and destroy us all.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.331"/>And again another of the proud youths would say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.332-2.333"/>Who knows but he himself as he goes on the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus did? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.334"/>So would he cause us yet more labour;

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
for we should have to divide all his possessions, and his house we should give to his mother to possess, and to him who should wed her.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.335-2.336"/>So they spoke, but Telemachus went down to the high-roofed treasure-chamber of his father, a wide room where gold and bronze lay piled, and raiment in chests, and stores of fragrant oil.

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.340-2.343"/>There, too, stood great jars of wine, old and sweet, holding within them an unmixed divine drink, and ranged in order along the wall, if ever Odysseus should return home even after many grievous toils. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.344-2.345"/>Shut were

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>
the double doors, close-fitted; and there both night and day a stewardess abode, who guarded all in wisdom of mind, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.345-2.347"/>To her now Telemachus, when he had called her to the treasure-chamber, spoke, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.348"/>Nurse, draw me off wine in jars,

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>
sweet wine that is the choicest next to that which thou guardest ever thinking upon that ill-fated one, if haply Zeus-born Odysseus may come I know not whence, having escaped from death and the fates. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.353"/>Fill twelve jars and fit them all with covers, and pour me barley meal into well-sewn skins,

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
and let there be twenty measures of ground barley meal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.355"/>But keep knowledge hereof to thyself, and have all these things brought together; for at evening I will fetch them, when my mother goes to her upper chamber and bethinks her of her rest. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.356"/>For I am going to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>

to seek tidings of the return of my dear father, if haply I may hear any.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.361-2.362"/>So he spoke, and the dear nurse, Eurycleia, uttered a shrill cry, and weeping spoke to him winged words:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.363-2.364"/>Ah, dear child, how has this thought come into thy mind? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.364-2.365"/>Whither art thou minded to go over the wide earth,

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>
thou who art an only son and well-beloved? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.365-2.366"/>But he hath perished far from his country, the Zeus-born Odysseus, in a strange land; and these men, so soon as thou art gone, will devise evil for thee hereafter, that thou mayest perish by guile, and themselves divide all these possessions. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.367-2.368"/>Nay, abide here in charge of what is thine; thou hast no need

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the unresting sea.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.371"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.372"/>Take heart, nurse, for not without a god's warrant is this my plan. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.373-2.376"/>But swear to tell naught of this to my dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall come,

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
or until she shall herself miss me and hear that I am gone, that she may not mar her fair flesh with weeping.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.377"/>So he spoke, and the old woman swore a great oath by the gods to say naught. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.378-2.380"/>But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath, straightway she drew for him wine in jars,

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
and poured barley meal into well-sewn skins; and Telemachus went to the hall and joined the company of the wooers.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.381"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.382"/>In the likeness of Telemachus she went everywhere throughout the city, and to each of the men she drew near and spoke her word,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
bidding them gather at even beside the swift ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.386-2.387"/>Furthermore, of Noemon, the glorious son of Phronius, she asked a swift ship, and he promised it to her with a ready heart.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.387"/>Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.388-2.390"/>Then she drew the swift ship to the sea and

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
put in it all the gear that well-benched ships carry. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.391-2.392"/>And she moored it at the mouth of the harbor, and round about it the goodly company was gathered together, and the goddess heartened each man.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.392"/>Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.393"/>She went her way to the house of divine Odysseus,

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
and there began to shed sweet sleep upon the wooers and made them to wander in their drinking, and from their hands she cast the cups. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.395-2.396"/>But they rose to go to their rest throughout the city, and remained no long time seated, for sleep was falling upon their eyelids. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.397-2.398"/>But to Telemachus spoke flashing-eyed Athena,

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
calling him forth before the stately hall, having likened herself to Mentor both in form and in voice:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.402-2.403"/>Telemachus, already thy well-greaved comrades sit at the oar and await thy setting out.

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.405-2.406"/>So saying, Pallas Athena led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.406"/>Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they found on the shore their long-haired comrades, and the strong and mighty<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.407-2.408"/>Telemachus spoke among them:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.410"/>Come, friends, let us fetch the stores, for all are now gathered together in the hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.410-2.411"/>My mother knows naught hereof, nor the handmaids either: one only heard my word.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.411-2.412"/>Thus saying, he led the way, and they went along with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.413"/>So they brought and

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
stowed everything in the well-benched ship, as the dear son of Odysseus bade. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.416-2.417"/>Then on board the ship stepped Telemachus, and Athena went before him and sat down in the stern of the ship, and near her sat Telemachus, while the men loosed the stern cables and themselves stepped on board, and sat down upon the benches.

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.420-2.421"/>And flashing-eyed Athena sent them a favorable wind, a strong-blowing West wind that sang over the wine-dark sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.422-2.423"/>And Telemachus called to his men, and bade them lay hold of the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.423"/>The mast of fir

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
they raised and set in the hollow socket, and made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of ox-hide. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.427-2.428"/>So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship as she went, and she sped over the wave accomplishing her way.

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.430-2.433"/>Then, when they had made the tackling fast in the swift black ship, they set forth bowls brim full of wine, and poured libations to the immortal gods that are forever, and chiefest of all to the flashing-eyed daughter of Zeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:2.434"/>So all night long and through the dawn the ship cleft her way.</p>

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.5-3.6"/>Here the townsfolk on the shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-shaker.

the others put straight in to the shore, and hauled up and furled the sail of the shapely ship, and moored her, and themselves stepped forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.13"/>And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, spake first to him, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.15-3.16"/>For to this end hast thou sailed over the sea, that thou mightest seek tidings of thy father,—where the earth covered him, and what fate he met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.20"/>A lie will he not utter, for he is wise indeed.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.20"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.21"/>Mentor, how shall I go, and how shall I greet him? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.22"/>I am as yet all unversed in subtle speech, and moreover a young man has shame to question an elder.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.25"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.26-3.27"/>Telemachus, somewhat thou wilt of thyself devise in thy breast, and somewhat heaven too will prompt thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.27-3.28"/>For, methinks, not without the favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.29-3.30"/>So spake Pallas Athena, and led the way

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>
quickly; but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess; and they came to the gathering and the companies of the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.30"/>There Nestor sat with his sons, and round about his people, making ready the feast, were roasting some of the meat and putting other pieces on spits. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.31-3.33"/>But when they saw the strangers they all came thronging about them,

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
and clasped their hands in welcome, and bade them sit down. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.36-3.39"/>First Nestor's son Peisistratus came near and took both by the hand, and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea, beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father.

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.40-3.41"/>Thereupon he gave them portions of the inner meat and poured wine in a golden cup, and, pledging her, he spoke to Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.51"/>But Pallas Athena rejoiced at the man's wisdom and judgment, in that to her first he gave the golden cup; and straightway she prayed earnestly to the lord Poseidon:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.55-3.56"/>Hear me, Poseidon, thou Earth-enfolder, and grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these deeds to fulfillment.

and grant furthermore that Telemachus and I may return when we have accomplished all that for which we came hither with our swift black ship.</q>

of the strangers who they are, since now they have had their joy of food. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.71"/>Strangers, who are ye? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.71"/>Whence do ye sail over the watery ways? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.72-3.74"/>Is it on some business, or do ye wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.75-3.76"/>Then wise Telemachus took courage, and made answer, for Athena herself put courage in his heart, that he might ask about his father that was gone, and that good report might be his among men:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.385"/>So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.430-3.435"/>The heifer came from the plain and from the swift, shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted Telemachus; the smith came, bearing in his hands his tools of bronze, the implements of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made tongs,

wherewith he wrought the gold; and Athena came to accept the sacrifice. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.435-3.436"/>Then the old man, Nestor, the driver of chariots, gave gold, and the smith prepared it, and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer, that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering.

and Aretus came from the chamber, bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers, and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in fight, stood by, holding in his hands a sharp axe, to fell the heifer; and Perseus held the bowl for the blood. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.440-3.443"/>Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots,

began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.</p>

of the neck, and loosened the strength of the heifer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.450-3.452"/>Then the women raised the sacred cry, the daughters and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor, Eurydice, the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus, and the men raised the heifer's head from the broad-wayed earth and held it, and Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.455-3.458"/>And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones, at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order, and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh upon them.

and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.460"/>But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the inner parts, they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it, holding the pointed spits in their hands.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.461-3.463"/>Meanwhile the fair Polycaste,

the youngest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus, bathed Telemachus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.471-3.472"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, was first to speak, saying:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.475-3.476"/>My sons, up, yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car, that he may get forward on his journey.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.477-3.478"/>So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.479-3.480"/>And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
and dainties, such as kings, fostered of Zeus, are wont to eat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.481"/>Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car, and Peisistratus, son of Nestor, a leader of men, mounted beside him, and took the reins in his hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.482-3.485"/>He touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped on

to the plain, and left the steep citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.486"/>So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:3.487-3.489"/>Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark.

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.15-4.17"/>So they were feasting in the great high-roofed hall, the neighbors and kinsfolk of glorious Menelaus, and making merry; and among them a divine minstrel was singing to the lyre, and two tumblers whirled up and down through the midst of them, as he began his song.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.20-4.22"/>Then the two, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor, halted at the gateway of the palace, they and their two horses. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.22-4.25"/>And the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw them, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus; and he went through the hall to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people.

and tied them at the stalls of the horses, and flung before them spelt, and mixed therewith white barley.

for there was a gleam as of sun or moon over the high-roofed house of glorious Menelaus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.68-4.70"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, lo, then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor,

holding his head close to him, that the others might not hear:

such untold wealth is here; amazement holds me as I look.</q>

as for one only, who makes me to loathe both sleep and food, when I think of him; for no one of the Achaeans toiled so much as Odysseus toiled and endured.

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.120-4.122"/>While he pondered thus in mind and heart, forth then from her fragrant high-roofed chamber came Helen, like Artemis of the golden arrows;<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> and with her came Adraste, and placed for her a chair, beautifully wrought, and Alcippe brought a rug of soft wool

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.128-4.129"/>He gave to Menelaus two silver baths and two tripods and ten talents of gold.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.130"/>And besides these, his wife gave to Helen also beautiful gifts,—a golden distaff and a basket with wheels beneath did she give, a basket of silver, and with gold were the rims thereof gilded.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.131-4.132"/>This then the handmaid, Phylo, brought and placed beside her, filled with finely-spun yarn, and across it

was laid the distaff laden with violet-dark wool. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.136"/>So Helen sat down upon the chair, and below was a footstool for the feet; and at once she questioned her husband on each matter, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.140"/>Nay, my heart bids me speak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.141-4.146"/>For never yet, I declare, saw I one so like another, whether man or woman—amazement holds me, as I look—as this man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus, even Telemachus, whom that warrior left a new-born child in his house, when for the sake of shameless me ye Achaeans came up under the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, pondering in your hearts fierce war.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Such were his feet, such his hands,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.151-4.154"/>And verily but now, as I made mention of Odysseus and was telling of all the woe and toil he endured for my sake, this youth let fall a bitter tear from beneath his brows, holding up his purple cloak before his eyes.</q>

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.187-4.188"/>Telemachus wept, and Menelaus, son of Atreus, nor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.189"/>For he thought in his heart of peerless Antilochus, whom the glorious son of the bright Dawn<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> had slain.

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.197-4.198"/>Yea, this is the only due we pay to miserable mortals, to cut the hair and let a tear fall from the cheeks. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.199-4.200"/>For a brother of mine, too, is dead, nowise the meanest

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.200"/>As for me, I never met him nor saw him; but men say that Antilochus was above all others pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.200-4.201"/>Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.212-4.214"/>But we will cease the weeping which but now was made, and let us once more think of our supper, and let them pour water over our hands.

for Telemachus and me to tell to one another to the full.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.216-4.217"/>So he spoke, and Asphalion poured water over their hands, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.220-4.221"/>Straightway she cast into the wine of which they were drinking a drug to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill.

no, not though his mother and father should lie there dead, or though before his face men should slay with the sword his brother or dear son, and his own eyes beheld it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.227-4.230"/>Such cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus, drugs of healing, which Polydamna, the wife of <placeName key="tgn,1130814">Thon</placeName>, had given her, a woman of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, for there the earth, the giver of grain, bears greatest store

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
of drugs, many that are healing when mixed, and many that are baneful; there every man is a physician, wise above human kind; for they are of the race of Paeeon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.231-4.232"/>Now when she had cast in the drug, and had bidden pour forth the wine, again she made answer, and said:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.235-4.236"/>Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, and ye that are here, sons of noble men—though now to one and now to another Zeus gives good and ill, for he can do all things,—now verily sit ye in the halls and feast, and take ye joy in telling tales, for I will tell what fitteth the time.

and flinging a wretched garment about his shoulders, in the fashion of a slave he entered the broad-wayed city of the foe, and he hid himself under the likeness of another, a beggar, he who was in no wise such an one at the ships of the Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.247-4.248"/>In this likeness he entered the city of the Trojans, and all of them were but as babes.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.250-4.251"/>I alone recognized him in this disguise, and questioned him, but he in his cunning sought to avoid me.

before that he reached the swift ships and the huts, then at length he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.257-4.258"/>And when he had slain many of the Trojans with the long sword, he returned to the company of the Argives and brought back plentiful tidings.

was glad, for already my heart was turned to go back to my home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither from my dear native land, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber, and my husband, a man who lacked nothing, whether in wisdom or in comeliness.</q></p>

by some god, who wished to grant glory to the Trojans, and godlike Deiphobus followed thee on thy way. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.276"/>Thrice didst thou go about the hollow ambush, trying it with thy touch, and thou didst name aloud the chieftains of the Danaans by their names, likening thy voice to the voices of the wives of all the Argives.

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.280-4.281"/>Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat there in the midst and heard how thou didst call, and we two were eager to rise up and come forth, or else to answer straightway from within, but Odysseus held us back and stayed us, despite our eagerness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.285-4.287"/>Then all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace, but Anticlus alone was fain to speak and answer thee; but Odysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and saved all the Achaeans, and held him thus until Pallas Athena led thee away.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.290"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.292-4.293"/>But come, send us to bed, that lulled now

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
by sweet sleep we may rest and take our joy.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.296-4.299"/>Thus he spoke, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids place bedsteads beneath the portico, and to lay on them fair purple blankets, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing.

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.300-4.301"/>But the maids went forth from the hall with torches in their hands and strewed the couch, and a herald led forth the guests. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.301"/>So they slept there in the fore-hall of the palace, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor; but the son of Atreus slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house,

and beside him lay long-robed Helen, peerless among women.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.306-4.311"/>So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose Menelaus, good at the war-cry, and put on his clothing.

and went forth from his chamber like unto a god to look upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.325"/>And do thou no wise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.326-4.327"/>I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.641"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to him, saying: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.642-4.643"/>Tell me the truth; when did he go, and what youths went with him? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.643-4.644"/>Were they chosen youths of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, or hirelings and slaves of his own? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.644"/>Able would he be to accomplish even that.

<milestone ed="p" n="645" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.645-4.647"/>And tell me this truly, that I may know full well. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.648"/>Was it perforce and against thy will that he took from thee the black ship? or didst thou give it him freely of thine own will, because he besought thee?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.649"/>Then Noemon, son of Phronius, answered him:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.649-4.651"/>I myself freely gave it him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>What else could any man do,

<milestone ed="p" n="650" unit="line"/>
when a man like him, his heart laden with care, makes entreaty? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.651"/>Hard it were to deny the gift. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.652-4.653"/>The youths that are the noblest in the land after ourselves, even these have gone with him; and among them I noted one going on board as their leader, Mentor, or a god, who was in all things like unto Mentor.

<milestone ed="p" n="655" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.655"/>But at this I marvel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.655-4.656"/>I saw goodly Mentor here yesterday at early dawn; but at that time he embarked for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.657-4.658"/>So saying he departed to his father's house, but of those two the proud hearts were angered. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.659"/>The wooers they straightway made to sit down and cease from their games;

<milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line"/>
and among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in displeasure; and with rage was his black heart wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.660-4.661"/>Out upon him, verily a proud deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished.

<milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.665-4.666"/>Forth in despite of all of us here the lad is gone without more ado, launching a ship, and choosing the best men in the land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.667"/>He will begin by and by to be our bane; but to his own undoing may Zeus destroy his might before ever he reaches the measure of manhood. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.667-4.668"/>But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.673"/>Thus shall his voyaging in search of his father come to a sorry end.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.674"/>So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade him act. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And straightway they rose up and went to the house of Odysseus.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.675-4.676"/>Now Penelope was no long time without knowledge of the plans which the wooers were plotting in the deep of their hearts; for the herald Medon told her, who heard their counsel as he stood without the court and they within were weaving their plot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.677-4.678"/>So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to Penelope;

<milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>
and as he stepped across the threshold Penelope spoke to him and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.680"/>Herald, why have the lordly wooers sent thee forth? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.681"/>Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their tasks, and make ready a feast for them?

<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>
may they now feast here their latest and their last—even ye who are ever thronging here and wasting much livelihood, the wealth of wise Telemachus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.686-4.687"/>Surely ye hearkened not at all in olden days, when ye were children, when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus was among them that begat you,

<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>
in that he wrought no wrong in deed or word to any man in the land, as the wont is of divine kings—one man they hate and another they love. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.692"/>Yet he never wrought iniquity at all to any man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.693"/>But your mind and your unseemly deeds

<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>
are plain to see, nor is there in after days any gratitude for good deeds done.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.696"/>Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.697"/>I would, O queen, that this were the greatest evil. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.698-4.699"/>But another greater far and more grievous are the wooers planning, which I pray that the son of Cronos may never bring to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.700-4.701"/>They are minded to slay Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.701-4.702"/>So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.703-4.704"/>Long time she was speechless, and both her eyes

<milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/>
were filled with tears, and the flow of her voice was checked. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.706"/>But at last she made answer, and said to him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.707"/>Herald, why is my son gone? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.707-4.709"/>He had no need to go on board swift-faring ships, which serve men as horses of the deep, and cross over the wide waters of the sea.

<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.710"/>Was it that not even his name should be left among men?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.711"/>Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.712-4.714"/>I know not whether some god impelled him, or whether his own heart was moved to go to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, that he might learn either of his father's return or what fate he had met.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.715"/>So he spoke, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and on her fell a cloud of soul-consuming grief, and she had no more the heart to sit upon one of the many seats that were in the room, but down upon the threshold of her fair-wrought chamber she sank, moaning piteously, and round about her wailed her handmaids,

<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>
even all that were in the house, both young and old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.721"/>Among these with sobs of lamentation spoke Penelope:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.722"/>Hear me, my friends, for to me the Olympian has given sorrow above all the women who were bred and born with me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.722-4.723"/>For long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart,

pre-eminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband, whose fame is wide through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and mid-<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.727-4.728"/>And now again my well-loved son have the storm-winds swept away from our halls without tidings, nor did I hear of his setting forth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.729-4.731"/>Cruel, that ye are! Not even you took thought, any one of you,

to rouse me from my couch, though in your hearts ye knew full well when he went on board the hollow black ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.732-4.734"/>For had I learned that he was pondering this journey, he should verily have stayed here, how eager soever to be gone, or he should have left me dead in the halls.

<milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.735-4.741"/>But now let one hasten to call hither the aged Dolius, my servant, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, and who keeps my garden of many trees, that he may straightway go and sit by Laertes, and tell him of all these things. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So haply may Laertes weave some plan in his heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/>
and go forth and with weeping make his plea to the people, who are minded to destroy his race and that of godlike Odysseus.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.742"/>Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.743-4.744"/>Dear lady, thou mayest verily slay me with the pitiless sword or let me abide in the house, yet will I not hide my word from thee.

<milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.745-4.746"/>I knew all this, and gave him whatever he bade me, bread and sweet wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.746-4.749"/>But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee until at least the twelfth day should come, or thou shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weeping.

<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.750-4.752"/>But now bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then go up to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids and pray to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis; for she may then save him even from death. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.753"/>And trouble not a troubled old man; for

<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>
the race of the son of Arceisius is not, methinks, utterly hated by the blessed gods, but there shall still be one, I ween, to hold the high-roofed halls and the rich fields far away.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.758"/>So she spoke, and lulled Penelope's laments, and made her eyes to cease from weeping. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.759-4.761"/>She then bathed, and took clean raiment for her body,

<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>
and went up to her upper chamber with her handmaids, and placing barley grains in a basket prayed to Athena:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.762-4.766"/>Hear me, child of Zeus who bears the aegis, unwearied one. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>If ever Odysseus, of many wiles, burnt to thee in his halls fat thigh-pieces of heifer or ewe,

remember these things now, I pray thee, and save my dear son, and ward off from him the wooers in their evil insolence.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.767"/>So saying she raised the sacred cry, and the goddess heard her prayer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.768"/>But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.770-4.771"/>Aye, verily the queen, wooed of many, is preparing our marriage, nor does she know at all that death has been made ready for her son.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.772"/>So would one of them speak; but they knew not how these things were to be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.773"/>And Antinous addressed their company, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.774-4.775"/>Good sirs,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> shun haughty speech

of every kind alike, lest someone report your speech even within the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.776-4.777"/>Nay come, in silence thus let us arise and put into effect our plan which pleased us one and all at heart.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.778-4.779"/>So he spoke, and chose twenty men that were best, and they went their way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea.

<milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.780-4.783"/>The ship first of all they drew down to the deep water, and set the mast and sail in the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white sail. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.784"/>And proud squires brought them their weapons.

<milestone ed="p" n="785" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.785"/>Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and themselves disembarked. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.786"/>There then they took supper, and waited till evening should come.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.787-4.790"/>But she, the wise Penelope, lay there in her upper chamber, touching no food, tasting neither meat nor drink, pondering whether her peerless son would escape death,

<milestone ed="p" n="790" unit="line"/>
or be slain by the insolent wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.791-4.793"/>And even as a lion is seized with fear and broods amid a throng of men, when they draw their crafty ring about him, so was she pondering when sweet<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> sleep came upon her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.794"/>And she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.795"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.796-4.798"/>She made a phantom, and likened it in form to a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose home was in Pherae.

to Penelope in the midst of her wailing and lamenting, to bid her cease from weeping and tearful lamentation. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.802-4.803"/>So into the chamber it passed by the thong of the bolt, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.805-4.807"/>Nay, the gods that live at ease suffer thee not to weep or be distressed, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for in no wise is he a sinner in the eyes of the gods.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.807"/>Then wise Penelope answered her, as she slumbered very sweetly at the gates of dreams:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.810"/>Why, sister, art thou come hither? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.810-4.811"/>Thou hast not heretofore been wont to come, for thou dwellest in a home far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.817-4.818"/>And now again my well-loved son is gone forth in a hollow ship, a mere child, knowing naught of toils and the gatherings of men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.819"/>For him I sorrow even more than for that other,

<milestone ed="p" n="820" unit="line"/>
and tremble for him, and fear lest aught befall him, whether it be in the land of the men to whom he is gone, or on the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.820-4.821"/>For many foes are plotting against him, eager to slay him before he comes back to his native land.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.822-4.823"/>Then the dim phantom answered her, and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="825" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.825"/>Take heart, and be not in thy mind too sore afraid; since such a guide goes with him as men have full often besought to stand by their side, for she has power,—even Pallas Athena. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.826-4.828"/>And she pities thee in thy sorrow, for she it is that has sent me forth to tell thee this.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="830" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.830"/>Then again wise Penelope answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.831-4.834"/>If thou art indeed a god, and hast listened to the voice of a god, come, tell me, I pray thee, also of that hapless one, whether he still lives and beholds the light of the sun, or whether he is already dead and in the house of Hades.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="835" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:4.835"/>And the dim phantom answered her, and said:<q>

immortal, golden, which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind.

Therein birds long of wing were wont to nest, owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering tongues, who ply their business on the sea.

and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.77-5.78"/>Nor did Calypso, the beautiful goddess, fail to know him, when she saw him face to face;

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.105-5.108"/>He says that there is here with thee a man most wretched above all those warriors who around the city of Priam fought for nine years, and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.108-5.109"/>But on the way they sinned against Athena, and she sent upon them an evil wind and long waves.

his high-roofed house and his native land.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.116-5.117"/>So he spoke, and Calypso, the beautiful goddess, shuddered, and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.125-5.127"/>Thus too, when fair-tressed Demeter, yielding to her passion, lay in love with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow land,

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.130-5.132"/>Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and all alone, for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with his bright thunder-bolt, and had shattered<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> it in the midst of the wine-dark sea.

over the unresting sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.140"/>But it is not I that shall give him convoy,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.151-5.153"/>  and his eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away, as he longed mournfully for his return, for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.154-5.155"/>By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
in the hollow caves, unwilling beside the willing nymph, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.156-5.158"/> but by day he would sit on the rocks and the sands, racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.159"/>Then coming close to him, the beautiful goddess addressed him:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.160-5.161"/>Unhappy man, sorrow no longer here, I pray thee, nor let thy life pine away; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.161"/> for even now with a ready heart will I send thee on thy way. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.162-5.163"/>Nay, come, hew with the axe long beams, and make a broad raft,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.163-5.164"/> and fasten upon it cross-planks for a deck well above it, that it may bear thee over the misty deep.

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.165-5.167"/>And I will place therein bread and water and red wine to satisfy thy heart, to keep hunger from thee. 

And I will clothe thee with raiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.167-5.170"/>I will send a fair wind behind thee, that all unscathed thou mayest return to thy native land, if it be the will of the gods who hold broad heaven;

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
for they are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.171-5.172"/>So she spoke, and much-enduring goodly Odysseus shuddered, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.173-5.175"/>Some other thing, goddess, art thou planning in this, and not my sending, seeing that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea,

dread and grievous,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.177-5.179"/>But I will not set foot on a raft in thy despite, unless thou, goddess, wilt bring thyself to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.180-5.181"/>So he spoke, but Calypso, the beautiful goddess, smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and spoke, and addressed him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.184-5.187"/>Now therefore let earth be witness to this, and the broad heaven above,

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
and the down-flowing water of the Styx, which is the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods, that I will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt.

and he sat down upon the chair from which Hermes had arisen, and the nymph set before him all manner of food to eat and drink, of such sort as mortal men eat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.200"/>So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.201-5.202"/>But when they had their fill of food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was the first to speak, and said:
    <q>

would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.206-5.210"/>Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me, and wouldest be immortal, for all thy desire to see

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
thy wife for whom thou longest day by day. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.211-5.213"/>Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature, for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.214"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.215"/>Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for this. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.215-5.217`"/>I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.218"/>  for she is a mortal, while thou art immortal and ageless. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.219-5.220"/>But even so I wish and long day by day

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
to reach my home, and to see the day of my return. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.221-5.222"/>And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-dark sea, I will endure it, having in my breast a heart that endures affliction.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe, finely woven and beautiful, and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold, and on her head a veil above. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.233"/>Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.234-5.235"/>She gave him a great axe, well fitted to his hands,

long dry and well-seasoned, which would float for him lightly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.241-5.243"/>But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, returned homewards, but he fell to cutting timbers,

then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.246"/>Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him augers;

and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another, and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.255"/> and furthermore made him a steering-oar, wherewith to steer.

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.260-5.261"/>And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets, and then with levers<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> forced it down into the bright sea.</p>

and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.290"/>Aye, but even yet, methinks, I shall drive him to surfeit of evil.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.291-5.292"/>So saying, he gathered the clouds, and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.292-5.294"/> and  he roused all blasts of all manner of winds, and hid with clouds land and sea alike; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.294"/> and night rushed down from heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.300-5.302"/>I fear me that verily all that the goddess said was true, when she declared that on the sea, before ever I came to my native land, I should fill up my measure of woes;

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.315-5.316"/>Far from the raft he fell, and let fall the steering-oar from his hand;

but sprang after it amid the waves, and laid hold of it, and sat down in the midst of it, seeking to escape the doom of death;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.336-5.338"/>She was touched with pity for Odysseus, as he wandered and was in sore travail, and she rose up from the deep like a sea-mew on the wing, and sat on the stoutly-bound raft, and spoke, saying:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.339-5.340"/>Unhappy man, how is it that Poseidon, the earth-shaker,

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.341"/>Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee for all his rage. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.342"/>Nay, do thou thus; and methinks thou dost not lack understanding. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.343-5.345"/>Strip off these garments, and leave thy raft to be driven by the winds, but do thou swim with thy hands and so strive to reach

the land of the Phaeacians, where it is thy fate to escape. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.346-5.347"/>Come, take this veil, and stretch it beneath thy breast. 

It is immortal; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.347"/> there is no fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.348-5.350"/>But when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land, loose it from thee, and cast it into the wine-dark sea

far from the land, and thyself turn away.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.351-5.353"/>So saying, the goddess gave him the veil, and herself plunged again into the surging deep, like a sea-mew; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.353"/> and the dark wave hid her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.354-5.355"/>Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus pondered,

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.360"/>But this will I do, and meseems that this is best: 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.361-5.362"/>
as long as the timbers hold firm in their fastenings, so long will I remain here and endure to suffer affliction; 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.363-5.364"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.365-5.367"/>While he pondered thus in mind and heart, Poseidon, the earth-shaker, made to rise up a great wave, dread and grievous, arching over from above, and drove it upon him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.368-5.369"/>And as when a strong wind tosses a heap of straw that is dry,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.370"/> even so the wave scattered the long timbers of the raft. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.370-5.372"/>But Odysseus bestrode one plank, as though he were riding a horse, and stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.373-5.375"/>Then straightway he stretched the veil beneath his breast, and flung himself headlong into the sea with hands outstretched,

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
ready to swim. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.375-5.376"/>And the lord, the earth-shaker, saw him, and he shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own heart:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.377-5.378"/>So now, after thou hast suffered many ills, go wandering over the deep, till thou comest among the folk fostered of Zeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.379"/>Yet even so, methinks, thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.380-5.381"/>So saying, he lashed his fair-maned horses, and came to <placeName key="tgn,1041944">Aegae</placeName>, where is his glorious palace.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.382"/>But Athena, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.383-5.384"/>She stayed the paths of the other winds, and bade them all cease and be lulled to rest;

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.385-5.387"/> but she roused the swift <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName>, and broke the waves before him, to the end that Zeus-born Odysseus might come among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, escaping from death and the fates.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.388-5.389"/>Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves, and full often his heart forboded destruction.

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.390-5.392"/>But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.392-5.393"/> and he caught sight of the shore close at hand, casting a quick glance forward, as he was raised up by a great wave. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.394-5.399"/>And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
of a father who lies in sickness, bearing grievous pains, long while wasting away, and some cruel god assails him, but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe, so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome; and he swam on, eager to set foot on the land.

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.400-5.401"/>But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.402-5.403"/>
for the great wave thundered against the dry land, belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.404"/> for there were neither harbors where ships might ride, nor road-steads,

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.405"/> 

but projecting headlands, and reefs, and cliffs—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.406-5.407"/> then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.408-5.410"/>Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf,

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.411-5.414"/>For without are sharp crags, and around them the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer, and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin.

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.415-5.416"/>Haply were I to seek to land, a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.416"/> and so shall my striving be in vain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.417-5.422"/>But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> and harbors of the sea, I fear me lest the storm-wind may catch me up again,

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
and bear me, groaning heavily, over the teeming deep; or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the sea—and many such does glorious Amphitrite breed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.423"/>For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.424-5.425"/>While he pondered thus in mind and heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
a great wave bore him against the rugged shore. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.426-5.427"/>There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put a thought in his mind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.428-5.429"/>On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went by.

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.430-5.431"/>Thus then did he escape this wave, but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him, and flung him far out in the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.432-5.435"/>And just as, when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its suckers, even so from his strong hands

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>
were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.435"/> and the great wave covered him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.436-5.437"/>Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate, had not flashing-eyed Athena given him prudence. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.438-5.440"/>Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore, he swam outside, looking ever toward the land in hope to find

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
shelving beaches and harbors of the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.441-5.444"/>But when, as he swam, he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in his heart:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.445"/>Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.445-5.446"/>As to one greatly longed-for<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> do I come to thee, seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.447-5.449"/>Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees, after many toils.

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.450"/>Nay, pity me, O king,

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.451-5.453"/>So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of the river. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.453-5.454"/>And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.454"/> for his spirit was crushed by the sea.

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.455-5.456"/>And all his flesh was swollen, and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.456-5.457"/>So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce strength to move; for terrible weariness had come upon him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.458-5.459"/>But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast, then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward;

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.460-5.462"/>
and the great wave bore it back down the stream, and straightway Ino received it in her hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.462-5.463"/>
But Odysseus, going back from the river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth, the giver of grain; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.464"/>
and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.465"/>Ah, woe is me! what is to befall me? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.465"/> What will happen to me at the last? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.466-5.468"/>If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.469"/> and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning.

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.470-5.473"/>But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood, in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me, and if sweet sleep comes over me, I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.474"/>Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him the better:

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.475"/> he went his way to the wood and 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.475-5.476"/> he found it near the water in a clear space; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.476-5.477"/> and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.477"/> one of thorn and one of olive. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.478-5.480"/>

Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the rays of the bright sun beat,


nor could the rain pierce through them, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.480-5.481"/> so closely did they grow, intertwining one with the other. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.481-5.482"/>Beneath these Odysseus crept 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.482-5.483"/> and he straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.483-5.485"/> for fallen leaves were there in plenty, enough to shelter two men or three

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>
in winter-time, however bitter the weather. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.486-5.487"/>And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus saw it, and was glad, and he lay down in the midst, and heaped over him the fallen leaves. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.488-5.491"/>And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm, a man who has no neighbors,

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
and so saves a seed of fire, that he may not have to kindle it from some other source, so Odysseus covered himself with leaves. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5.491-5.492"/>And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes, that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.1-6.2"/>So he lay there asleep, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, overcome with sleep and weariness; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.2-6.6"/>but Athena went to the land and city of the Phaeacians. 

These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
hard by the Cyclopes, men overweening in pride who plundered them continually and were mightier than they. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.7-6.10"/>From thence Nausithous, the godlike, had removed them, and led and settled them in <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName> far from men that live by toil. 

About the city he had drawn a wall, he had built houses

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>
and made temples for the gods, and divided the ploughlands; 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.11-6.12"/> but he, ere now, had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and Alcinous was now king, made wise in counsel by the gods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.13-6.14"/>To his house went the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, to contrive the return of great-hearted Odysseus.

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.15-6.19"/>She went to a chamber, richly wrought, wherein slept a maiden like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous; hard by slept two hand-maidens, gifted with beauty by the Graces, one on either side of the door-posts,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.19"/> and the bright doors were shut.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.20-6.23"/>But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, taking the form of the daughter of Dymas, famed for his ships, a girl who was of like age with Nausicaa, and was dear to her heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.24"/>Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.25"/>Nausicaa, how comes it that thy mother bore thee so heedless? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.26-6.28"/>Thy bright raiment is lying uncared for; yet thy marriage is near at hand, when thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments, and give other such to those who escort thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.29-6.30"/>It is from things like these, thou knowest, that good report goeth up among men,

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>
and the father and honored mother rejoice. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.31"/>Nay, come, let us go to wash them at break of day, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.32-6.33"/> for I will follow with thee to aid thee, that thou mayest with speed make thee ready; for thou shalt not long remain a maiden. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.34-6.35"/>Even now thou hast suitors in the land, the noblest

of all the Phaeacians, from whom is thine own lineage. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.36-6.38"/>Nay, come, bestir thy noble father early this morning that he make ready mules and a wagon for thee, to bear the girdles and robes and bright coverlets. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.39-6.40"/>And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
to go thus than on foot,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.41-6.43"/>So saying, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, departed to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, where, they say, is the abode of the gods that stands fast forever. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.43-6.45"/>Neither is it shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain, nor does snow fall upon it, but the air

At once then came fair-throned Dawn and awakened Nausicaa of the beautiful robes, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.49-6.51"/> and straightway she marvelled at her dream,

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>
and went through the house to tell her parents, her father dear and her mother; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.51"/>  and she found them both within. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.52-6.53"/>The mother sat at the hearth with her handmaidens, spinning the yarn of purple dye, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.53-6.55"/> and her father she met as he was going forth to join the glorious kings

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
in the place of council, to which the lordly Phaeacians called him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.56"/>But she came up close to her dear father, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.57-6.59"/>Papa dear, wilt thou not make ready for me a wagon, high and stout of wheel, that I may take to the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine which is lying here soiled?

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.60"/>Moreover for thyself it is seemly that when thou art at council with the princes 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.61"/> thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.62-6.63"/> and thou hast five sons living in thy halls—two are wedded, but three are sturdy bachelors—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.64-6.65"/> and these ever wish to put on them freshly-washed raiment,

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>
when they go to the dance. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.65"/>Of all this must I take thought.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.66"/>So she spoke, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.66-6.67"/> for she was ashamed to name gladsome<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> marriage to her father; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.67"/> but he understood all, and answered, saying: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.68"/>Neither the mules do I begrudge thee, my child, nor aught beside. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.69"/>Go thy way; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.69-6.70"/> the slaves shall make ready for thee the wagon,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.71"/>With this he called to the slaves, and they hearkened. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.72-6.73"/>Outside the palace they made ready the light-running mule wagon, and led up the mules and yoked them to it; 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.74"/> and the maiden brought from her chamber the bright raiment,

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.75-6.78"/> and she placed it upon the polished car, while her mother put in a chest food of all sorts to satisfy the heart. 

Therein she put dainties, and poured wine in a goat-skin flask; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.78"/> and the maiden mounted upon the wagon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.79-6.80"/>Her mother gave her also soft olive oil in a flask of gold,

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>
that she and her maidens might have it for the bath. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.81-6.82"/> Then Nausicaa took the whip and the bright reins, and smote the mules to start them; 


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.82"/> and there was a clatter of the mules 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.83-6.84"/> as they sped on a main, bearing the raiment and the maiden; neither went she alone, for with her went her handmaids as well.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.85-6.88"/>Now when they came to the beautiful streams of the river, where were the washing tanks that never failed—for abundant clear water welled up from beneath and flowed over, to cleanse garments however soiled—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.89-6.90"/> there they loosed the mules from under the wagon and drove them along the eddying river

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
to graze on the honey-sweet water-grass, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.90-6.92"/>Now and they themselves took in their arms the raiment from the wagon, and bore it into the dark water, and trampled it in the trenches, busily vying each with each. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.93-6.95"/>Now when they had washed the garments, and had cleansed them of all the stains, they spread them out in rows on the shore of the sea where

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>
the waves dashing against the land washed the pebbles cleanest; 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.96-6.98"/> 

and they, after they had bathed and anointed themselves richly with oil, took their meal on the river's banks, and waited for the clothing to dry in the bright sunshine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.99-6.100"/>Then when they had had their joy of food, she and her handmaids,

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
they threw off their head-gear and fell to playing at ball, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.101"/> and white-armed Nausicaa was leader in the song.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.102-6.104"/>

And even as Artemis, the archer, roves over the mountains, along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus, joying in the pursuit of boars and swift deer,

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.105-6.106"/>

and with her sport the wood-nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis, and Leto is glad at heart—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.107-6.108"/>high above them all Artemis holds her head and brows, and easily may she be known, though all are fair—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.109"/>so amid her handmaidens shone the maid unwed.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.110-6.114"/>But when she was about to yoke the mules, and fold the fair raiment, in order to return homeward, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel, that Odysseus might awake and see the fair-faced maid, who should lead him to the city of the Phaeacians.

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.115"/>So then the princess tossed the ball to one of her maidens; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.116"/>So the maiden indeed she missed, but cast it into a deep eddy, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.117"/> and thereat they cried aloud, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.117-6.118"/> and goodly Odysseus awoke, and sat up, and thus he pondered in mind and heart:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.119"/>Woe is me! to the land of what mortals am I now come?

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.120-6.121"/>Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust? or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.122"/>There rang in my ears a cry as of maidens, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.123-6.124"/> of nymphs who haunt the towering peaks of the mountains, the springs that feed the rivers, and the grassy meadows!

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.125"/>Can it be that I am somewhere near men of human speech?

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.127-6.129"/>So saying the goodly Odysseus came forth from beneath the bushes, and with his stout hand he broke from the thick wood a leafy branch, that he might hold it about him and hide therewith his nakedness.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.130-6.132"/>Forth he came like a mountain-nurtured lion trusting in his might, who goes forth, beaten with rain and wind, but his two eyes are ablaze: 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.132-6.133"/>

into the midst of the kine he goes, or of the sheep, or on the track of the wild deer, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.133-6.134"/> 

and his belly bids him go even into the close-built fold, to make an attack upon the flocks.

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.135-6.136"/>Even so Odysseus was about to enter the company of the fair-tressed maidens, naked though he was, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.136"/> for need had come upon him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.137-6.138"/>But terrible did he seem to them, all befouled with brine, and they shrank in fear, one here, one there, along the jutting sand-spits. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.139"/>Alone the daughter of Alcinous kept her place, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.139-6.140"/> for


in her heart 

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> Athena put courage, and took fear from her limbs. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.141"/>She fled not, but stood and faced him; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.141-6.144"/> and Odysseus pondered whether he should clasp the knees of the fair-faced maid, and make his prayer, or whether, standing apart as he was, he should beseech her with gentle words, in hope that she might show him the city and give him raiment.

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.145-6.147"/>And, as he pondered, it seemed to him better to stand apart and beseech her with gentle words, lest the maiden's heart should be wroth with him if he clasped her knees; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.148"/>
so straightway he spoke a gentle word and crafty:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.149"/>I beseech thee, O queen,—

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.149"/> a goddess art thou, or art thou mortal?

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.150-6.152"/>If thou art a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven, to Artemis, the daughter of great Zeus, do I liken thee most nearly in comeliness and in stature and in form. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.153-6.155"/>But if thou art one of mortals who dwell upon the earth, thrice-blessed then are thy father and thy honored mother,

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
and thrice-blessed thy brethren. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.155-6.157"/>Full well, I ween, are their hearts ever warmed with joy because of thee, as they see thee entering the dance, a plant<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> so fair. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.158-6.159"/>But he again is blessed in heart above all others, who shall prevail with his gifts of wooing and lead thee to his home.

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.160-6.161"/>For never yet have mine eyes looked upon a mortal such as thou, whether man or woman;

for thither, too, I went, and much people followed with me,

Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark sea,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.172-6.173"/> and now fate has cast me ashore here, that here too, haply, I may suffer some ill. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.173-6.174"/>For not yet, methinks, will my troubles cease, but the gods ere that will bring many to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.175"/>Nay, O queen, have pity; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.175-6.177"/>

for it is to thee first that I am come after many grievous toils, and of the others who possess this city and land I know not one. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.178-6.179"/>Shew me the city, and give me some rag to throw about me, if thou hadst any wrapping for the clothes when thou camest hither.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.180-6.182"/>And for thyself, may the gods grant thee all that thy heart desires; a husband and a home may they grant thee, and oneness of heart—a goodly gift. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.182-6.184"/>For nothing is greater or better than this, when man and wife dwell in a home in one accord, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.184-6.185"/> a great grief to their foes

and a joy to their friends; but they know it<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> best themselves.</q></p>
   
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.186"/> <p>Then white-armed Nausicaa answered him:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.187"/>Stranger, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.190"/> so to thee, I ween, he has given this lot, and thou must in any case endure it.

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.195-6.197"/>The Phaeacians possess this city and land, and I am the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, upon whom depend the might and power of the Phaeacians.</q></p>
    <milestone unit="sentence" n="6.198"/> <p>She spoke, and called to her fair-tressed handmaids:<q>

Then they set Odysseus in a sheltered place, as Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, bade, and 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.214-6.216"/> beside him they put a cloak and a tunic for raiment,

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
and gave him soft olive oil in the flask of gold, and bade him bathe in the streams of the river. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.217"/>Then among the maidens spoke goodly Odysseus: <q>

anoint myself with olive oil

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.220"/> for of a truth it is long since oil came near my skin. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.221"/>But in your presence will I not bathe, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.221-6.222"/> for I am ashamed to make me naked in the midst of fair-tressed maidens.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.223"/>So he said, and they went apart and told the princess. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.224-6.226"/>But with water from the river goodly Odysseus washed from his skin

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
the brine which clothed his back and broad shoulders, and from his head he wiped the scurf of the unresting sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.227-6.231"/>But when he had washed his whole body and anointed himself with oil, and had put on him the raiment which the unwedded maid had given him, then Athena, the daughter of Zeus, made him

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made the locks to flow in curls like unto the hyacinth flower. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.232-6.235"/>And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces,

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.236-6.237"/>Then he went apart and sat down on the shore of the sea, gleaming with beauty and grace;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.237"/> and the damsel marvelled at him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.238"/> She spoke to her fair-tressed handmaids, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.239"/>Listen, white-armed maidens, that I may say somewhat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.240-6.241"/>Not without the will of all the gods who hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> does this man come among the godlike Phaeacians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.247-6.248"/>So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed, and set before Odysseus food and drink. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.249-6.250"/>Then verily did the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drink and eat,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.251"/>But the white-armed Nausicaa took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.252-6.254"/>She folded the raiment and put it in the fair wagon, and yoked the stout-hoofed mules, and mounted the car herself. 

Then she hailed Odysseus, and spoke and addressed him:

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.255-6.257"/>Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to the city, that I may escort thee to the house of my wise father, where, I tell thee, thou shalt come to know all the noblest of the Phaeacians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.258"/>Only do thou thus, and, methinks, thou dost not lack understanding: 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.259-6.261"/> so long as we are passing through the country and the tilled fields of men go thou quickly

with the handmaids behind the mules and the wagon, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.261"/> and I will lead the way. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.262-6.264"/>But when we are about to enter the city, around which runs a lofty wall,—a fair harbor lies on either side of the city and the entrance is narrow,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.264-6.265"/> and curved ships 
<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
are drawn up along the road, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.265"/> for they all have stations for their ships, each man one for himself. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.266-6.267"/>There, too, is their place of assembly about the fair temple of Poseidon, fitted with huge<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> stones set deep in the earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.268-6.269"/>Here the men are busied with the tackle of their black ships, with cables and sails, and here they shape the thin oar-blades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.270-6.272"/>For the Phaeacians care not for bow or quiver, but for masts and oars of ships, and for the shapely ships, rejoicing in which they cross over the grey sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.273-6.274"/>It is their ungentle speech that I shun, lest hereafter some man should taunt me,

Better so, even if she has herself gone forth and found a husband from another people;

thou mayest win from my father an escort and a return to thy land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.291-6.292"/>Thou wilt find a goodly grove of Athena hard by the road, a grove of poplar trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.300-6.301"/>Easily may it be known, and a child could guide thee, a mere babe;

for the houses of the Phaeacians are no wise built of such sort as is the palace of the lord Alcinous.

to my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.310-6.312"/>Him pass thou by, and cast thy hands about my mother's knees, that thou mayest quickly see with rejoicing the day of thy return, though thou art come from never so far.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.316-6.317"/>So saying, she smote the mules with the shining whip, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.317"/> and they quickly left the streams of the river. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.318"/>Well did they trot, well did they ply their ambling feet,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>

the maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot, and with judgment did she ply the lash. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.321-6.322"/>Then the sun set, and they came to the glorious grove, sacred to Athena. 

There Odysseus sat him down, 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.323"/>and he straightway prayed to the daughter of great Zeus: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.328"/>So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6.329"/> but she did not yet appear to him face to face,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.1-7.2"/>So he prayed there, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, while the two strong mules bore the maiden to the city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.3-7.6"/>But when she had come to the glorious palace of her father, she halted the mules at the outer gate, and her brothers

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
thronged about her, men like the immortals, and loosed the mules from the wagon, and bore the raiment within; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.7"/> and she herself went to her chamber. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.7-7.9"/> There a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman, Eurymedusa, an aged dame from Apeire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.10-7.11"/> Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire,

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>
and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous, for that he was king over all the Phaeacians, and the people hearkened to him as to a god. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.12"/>She it was who had reared the white-armed Nausicaa in the palace,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.13"/> and she it was who kindled the fire for her, and made ready her supper in the chamber.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.14"/>Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.14-7.17"/> and Athena,

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
with kindly purpose, cast about him a thick mist, that no one of the great-hearted Phaeacians, meeting him, should speak mockingly to him, and ask him who he was. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.18-7.20"/>But when he was about to enter the lovely city, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, met him

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>
in the guise of a young maiden carrying a pitcher,

from afar, from a distant country; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.25-7.26"/> wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.27"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.28-7.29"/>Then verily, Sir stranger, I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me, for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father.

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.30-7.31"/>Only go thou quietly, and I will lead the way. 

But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.32-7.33"/>for the men here endure not stranger-folk, nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.34-7.35"/>They, indeed, trusting in the speed of their swift ships,

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
cross over the great gulf of the sea, for this the Earth-shaker has granted them;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.38"/> and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>


And as he went through the city in the midst of them,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.39-7.40"/> the Phaeacians, famed for their ships, took no heed of him, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.40-7.42"/> for fair-tressed Athena, the dread goddess, would not suffer it, but shed about him a wondrous mist, for her heart was kind toward him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.43-7.45"/>And Odysseus marvelled at the harbors and the stately ships, at the meeting-places where the heroes themselves gathered, and the walls, long and

high and crowned with palisades, a wonder to behold. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.46-7.47"/>But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:
    <q>

feasting at the banquet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.50-7.51"/>Go thou within, and let thy heart fear nothing;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.53"/>The queen shalt thou approach first in the palace; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.54-7.55"/> Arete is the name by which she is called,

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
and she is sprung from the same line as is the king Alcinous. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.56-7.59"/>Nausithous at the first was born from the earth-shaker Poseidon and Periboea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was king over the insolent Giants.

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.60"/>But he brought destruction on his froward people, and was himself destroyed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.61-7.62"/>But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son, great-hearted Nausithous, who ruled over the Phaeacians;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.63"/> and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.64-7.66"/>Rhexenor, when as yet he had no son, Apollo of the silver bow smote

in his hall, a bridegroom though he was, and he left only one daughter, Arete. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.66-7.68"/>Her Alcinous made his wife, and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored, of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.69-7.72"/> so heartily is she honored,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
and has ever been, by her children and by Alcinous himself and by the people, who look upon her as upon a goddess, and greet her as she goes through the city.

over the high-roofed house of great-hearted Alcinous.

Of silver was the lintel above, and of gold the handle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.95-7.97"/>Within, seats were fixed along the wall on either hand, from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and on them were thrown robes of soft fabric, cunningly woven, the handiwork of women. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.98-7.99"/>On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont to sit drinking and eating,

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
and others weave webs, or, as they sit, twirl the yarn, like unto the leaves<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> of a tall poplar tree; and from the closely-woven linen the soft olive oil drips down.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note>

cunning workers at the loom,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.145"/> and they marvelled as they looked upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.155-7.157"/>But at length there spoke among them the old lord Echeneus, who was an elder among the Phaeacians, well skilled in speech, and understanding all the wisdom of old.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.172-7.174"/>Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin, for him to wash,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.175-7.176"/>And the grave housewife brought and set before him bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.177"/>So the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drank and ate;

to all in the hall, that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt; for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.182-7.183"/>He spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups.

then is this some new thing which the gods are planning;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.208"/>Alcinous, far from thee be that thought; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.208-7.210"/> for I am not like the immortals, who hold broad heaven,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.211-7.212"/>Whomsoever ye know among men who bear greatest burden of woe, to them might I liken myself in my sorrows. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.213-7.214"/>Yea, and I could tell a yet longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by the will of the gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.215"/>But as for me, suffer me now to eat, despite my grief; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.216-7.221"/>for there is nothing more shameless than a hateful belly, which bids a man perforce take thought thereof, be he never so sore distressed and laden with grief at heart, even as I, too, am laden with grief at heart, yet ever does my belly

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
bid me eat and drink, and makes me forget all that I have suffered, and commands me to eat my fill. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.222-7.224"/>But do ye make haste at break of day, that ye may set me, hapless one, on the soil of my native land, even after my many woes.

and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.233"/>Then white-armed Arete was the first to speak;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.240"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.241-7.242"/>Hard were it, O queen, to tell to the end the tale of my woes, since full many have the heavenly gods given me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.243"/>But this will I tell thee, of which thou dost ask and enquire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.244"/>There is an isle, Ogygia, which lies far off in the sea.

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.245-7.246"/>Therein dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas, guileful Calypso, a dread goddess,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.246-7.247"/> and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.248-7.250"/> but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone, for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt,

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.251-7.253"/>There all the rest of my trusty comrades perished, but I clasped in my arms the keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for nine days, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.253-7.257"/> and on the tenth black night the gods brought me to the isle, Ogygia, where

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, a dread goddess. 

She took me to her home with kindly welcome, and gave me food, and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.258"/> but she could never persuade the heart in my breast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.259-7.260"/>There for seven years' space I remained continually, and ever

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.261-7.263"/>But when the eight year came in circling course, then she roused me and bade me go, either because of some message from Zeus, or because her own mind was turned. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.264-7.266"/>And she sent me on my way on a raft, stoutly bound, and gave me abundant store

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
of bread and sweet wine, and clad me in immortal raiment, and sent forth a gentle wind and warm. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.267-7.270"/>So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land; and my heart was glad,

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
ill-starred that I was; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.270-7.274"/> for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe, which Poseidon, the earth-shaker, sent upon me. 

For he stirred up the winds against me and stayed my course, and wondrously roused the sea, nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I groaned ceaselessly.

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.275"/>My raft indeed the storm shattered, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.275-7.277"/> but by swimming I clove my way through yon gulf of the sea, until the wind and the waves, as they bore me, brought me to your shores. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.278-7.279"/> There, had I sought to land, the waves would have hurled me upon the shore, and dashed me against the great crags and a cheerless place,

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.280-7.282"/> but I gave way, and swam back until I came to a river, where seemed to me the best place, since it was smooth of rocks, and besides there was shelter from the wind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.283-7.284"/>Forth then I staggered, and sank down, gasping for breath, and immortal night came on. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.284-7.286"/>Then I went forth from the heaven-fed river,


and lay down to sleep in the bushes, gathering leaves about me.

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.290-7.291"/>Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play, and amid them was she, fair as the goddesses. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.292"/>To her I made my prayer; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.292-7.294"/>and she in no wise failed in good understanding, to do as thou wouldst not deem that one of younger years would do on meeting thee; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.294"/> for younger folk are ever thoughtless.

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.295-7.296"/>She gave bread in plenty and sparkling wine, and bathed me in the river, and gave me this raiment. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.297"/>In this, for all my sorrows, have I told thee the truth.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.298"/>Then in turn Alcinous answered him, and said:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.299-7.301"/>Stranger, verily my daughter was not minded aright in this,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
that she did not bring thee to our house with her maidens. 

Yet it was to her first that thou didst make thy prayer.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.302"/>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.303"/>Prince, rebuke not for this, I pray thee, thy blameless daughter. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.304-7.306"/> She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens,

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>
but I would not for fear and shame, lest haply thy heart should darken with wrath as thou sawest it; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.307"/> for we are quick to anger, we tribes of men upon the earth.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.308"/>And again Alcinous answered him, and said:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.309-7.310"/>Stranger, not such is the heart in my breast,

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
to be filled with wrath without a cause. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.310"/>Better is due measure in all things. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.311-7.314"/>I would, O father Zeus, and Athena and Apollo, that thou, so goodly a man, and like-minded with me, wouldst have my daughter to wife, and be called my son, and abide here;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.334"/>Thus they spoke to one another,

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.335-7.338"/> and white-armed Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under cover of the portico, and to lay on it fair blankets of purple, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing.

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.340-7.341"/>But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, they came to Odysseus, and called to him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.343"/>Thus they spoke, and welcome did it seem to him to lay him down to sleep.

on the corded bedstead under the echoing portico. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7.346-7.347"/>But Alcinous lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.1-8.3"/>As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, the strong and mighty Alcinous rose from his couch, and up rose also Zeus-born Odysseus, the sacker of cities. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.4-8.5"/>And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
to the place of assembly of the Phaeacians, which was builded for them hard by their ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.6-8.7"/>Thither they came and sat down on the polished stones close by one another;

and she made him taller and sturdier to behold, that he might be welcomed by all the Phaeacians, and win awe and reverence, and might accomplish the many feats wherein the Phaeacians made trial of Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.24-8.25"/>Now when they were assembled and met together,

Alcinous addressed their assembly and spoke among them:

for her first voyage, and let men choose two and fifty youths from out the people, even those that have heretofore been the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.55"/>Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship,

and eight white-tusked boars, and two oxen of shambling gait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.62-8.63"/>Then the herald drew near, leading the good minstrel, whom the Muse loved above all other men, and gave him both good and evil;

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.65-8.66"/>For him Pontonous, the herald, set a silver-studded chair in the midst of the banqueters, leaning it against a tall pillar, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.67-8.69"/> and he hung the clear-toned lyre from a peg close above his head, and showed him how to reach it with his hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.69-8.70"/> And beside him he placed a basket and a beautiful table,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
and a cup of wine, to drink when his heart should bid him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.71"/>So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.72-8.78"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the Muse moved the minstrel to sing of the glorious deeds of warriors, from that lay the fame whereof had then reached broad heaven,

even the quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus, how once they strove with furious words at a rich feast of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men, was glad at heart that the best of the Achaeans were quarrelling;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.100-8.103"/>But now let us go forth, and make trial of all manner of games, that yon stranger may tell his friends, when he returns home, how far we excel other men in boxing and wrestling and leaping and in speed of foot.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.104"/>So saying, he led the way, and they followed him.

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.105-8.107"/>From the peg the herald hung the clear-toned lyre, and took Demodocus by the hand, and led him forth from the hall, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.107-8.108"/>T guiding him by the self-same road by which the others, the nobles of the Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.109-8.110"/>They went their way to the place of assembly, and with them went a great throng,

past counting; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.110"/>and up rose many noble youths. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.111-8.114"/>There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus, and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon and Anabesineus, and Amphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tecton;

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.115-8.117"/> and up rose also Euryalus, the peer of man-destroying Ares, the son of Naubolus, who in comeliness and form was the best of all the Phaeacians after peerless Laodamas; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.118-8.119"/> and up rose the three sons of noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and godlike Clytoneus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.121"/>A course was marked out for them from the turning point,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.121-8.122"/> and they all sped swiftly, raising the dust of the plain;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.123"/> but among them noble Clytoneus was far the best at running, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.124-8.125"/> and by as far as is the range<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> of a team of mules in fallow land,

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
by so far he shot to the front and reached the host, and the others were left behind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.126"/>Then they made trial of toilsome wrestling, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.127"/> and here in turn Euryalus excelled all the princes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.128"/>And in leaping Amphialus was best of all, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.129-8.130"/> and with the discus again far the best of all was Elatreus,

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>
and in boxing Laodamas, the good son of Alcinous. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.131-8.132"/>But when the hearts of all had taken pleasure in the contests, Laodamas, the son of Alcinous, spoke among them:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.133-8.134"/>Come, friends, let us ask yon stranger whether he knows and has learned any contests. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.134-8.136"/>In build, surely, he is no mean man,

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
in thighs and calves, and in his two arms above, his stout neck, and his great might. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.136-8.137"/>In no wise does he lack aught of the strength of youth, but he has been broken by many troubles. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.138-8.139"/>For to my mind there is naught worse than the sea to confound a man, be he never so strong.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.140"/>And Euryalus in turn answered him, and said:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.141"/>Laodamas, this word of thine is right fitly spoken. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.142"/>Go now thyself and challenge him, and make known thy word.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.143-8.144"/>Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this he came and took his stand in the midst and spoke to Odysseus:

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.145-8.146"/>Come, Sir stranger, do thou, too, make trial of the contests, if thou knowest any; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.146"/> and it must be that thou knowest contests, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.147-8.148"/> for there is no greater glory for a man so long as he lives than that which he achieves by his own hands and his feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.149"/>Nay, come, make trial, and cast away care from thy heart.

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.150-8.151"/>Thy journey shall no more be long delayed, nay, even now thy ship is launched and the crew is ready.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.152"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.153"/>Laodamas, why do ye mock me with this challenge? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.154-8.157"/>Sorrow is in my mind far more than contests,

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
seeing that in time past I have suffered much and toiled much, and now I sit in the midst of your assembly, longing for my return home, and making my prayer to the king and to all the people.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.158"/>Then again Euryalus made answer and taunted him to his face: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.159-8.164"/>Nay verily, stranger, for I do not liken thee to a man that is skilled

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
in contests, such as abound among men, but to one who, faring to and fro with his benched ship, is a captain of sailors who are merchantmen, one who is mindful of his freight, and has charge of a home-borne cargo, and the gains of his greed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.164"/>Thou dost not look like an athlete.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.165"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.166"/>Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.166"/> thou art as one blind with folly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.167-8.168"/>So true is it that the gods do not give gracious gifts to all alike, not form nor mind nor eloquence. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.169-8.171"/>For one man is inferior in comeliness,

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
but the god sets a crown<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> of beauty upon his words, and men look upon him with delight, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.171-8.173"/> and he speaks on unfalteringly with sweet modesty, and is conspicuous among the gathered people, and as he goes through the city men gaze upon him as upon a god. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.174-8.177"/>Another again is in comeliness like the immortals,

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
but no crown of grace is set about his words. 

So, in thy case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.178-8.179"/>
Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking thus unmannerly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.179-8.181"/>
I am not unskilled in sports

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
as thou pratest, nay, methinks I was among the first so long as I trusted in my youth and in my hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.182"/>But now I am bound by suffering and pains; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.182-8.183"/> for much have I endured in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.184"/>But even so, though I have suffered much, I will make trial of the contests,

<milestone ed="p" n="8.185" unit="line"/>
for thy word has stung me to the heart, and thou hast provoked me with thy speech.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.186-8.188"/>He spoke, and, leaping up with his cloak about him as it was, seized a discus larger than the rest and thick, no little heavier than those with which the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.189-8.190"/>This with a whirl he sent from his stout hand,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
and the stone hummed as it flew; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.190-8.192"/> and down they crouched to the earth, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships, beneath the rush of the stone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.192-8.193"/>Past the marks of all it flew, speeding lightly from his hand, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.193-8.194"/> and Athena, in the likeness of a man, set the mark, and she spoke and addressed him:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.195-8.197"/>Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this mark, groping for it with his hands, for it is in nowise confused with the throng of the others, but is far the first. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.197"/>Be thou of good cheer for this bout at least:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.198"/> no one of the Phaeacians will reach this, or cast beyond it.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:8.199-8.249">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.199-8.200"/>So she spoke, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad,

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
rejoicing that he saw a true friend in the lists. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.201"/>Then with a lighter heart he spoke among the Phaeacians:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.202"/>Reach this now, young men;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.202-8.203"/> and presently, methinks, I will send another after it, as far or even further. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.204-8.207"/>Of the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him,

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
let him come hither and make trial—for ye have greatly angered me—be it in boxing or in wrestling, aye, or in running, I care not; let any one come of all the Phaeacians, save Laodamas alone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.208"/>For he is my host, 
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.208"/>and who would quarrel with one that entertains him? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.209-8.211"/>Foolish is that man and worthless,

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
who challenges to a contest the host who receives him in a strange land; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.211"/> he does but mar his own fortunes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.212-8.213"/>But of all the rest I refuse none, and make light of none, but am fain to know them, and make trial of them man to man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.214"/>For in all things I am no weakling, even in all the contests that are practised among men.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.215"/>Well do I know how to handle the polished bow, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.216-8.218"/> and ever would I be the first to shoot and smite my man in the throng of the foe, even though many comrades stood by me and were shooting at the men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.219-8.220"/>Only Philoctetes excelled me with the bow

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
in the land of the Trojans, when we Achaeans shot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.221-8.222"/>But of all others I declare that I am best by far, of all mortals that are now upon the earth and eat bread. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.223-8.225"/>Yet with men of former days I will not seek to vie, with Heracles or with Eurytus of <placeName key="perseus,Oechalia">Oechalia</placeName>,

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
who strove even with the immortals in archery. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.226-8.227"/>Wherefore great Eurytus died soon, nor did old age come upon him in his halls, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.227-8.228"/> for Apollo waxed wroth and slew him, because he had challenged him to a contest with the bow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.229"/>And with the spear I throw farther than any other man can shoot with an arrow.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.230-8.231"/>In the foot race alone I fear that someone of the Phaeacians may out strip me, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.231-8.233"/> for cruelly have I been broken amid the many waves, since there was in my ship no lasting store of provisions; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.233"/> therefore my limbs are loosened.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.234"/>So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence;

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.235"/>
but Alcinous alone answered him and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.236-8.240"/>Stranger, since not ungraciously dost thou speak thus in our midst, but art minded to shew forth the prowess which waits upon thee, in anger that yonder man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in a way in which no mortal would make light of thy prowess,

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
who knew in his heart how to speak fitly; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.241-8.245"/> come, now, hearken to my words, that thou mayest tell to another hero, when in thy halls thou art feasting with thy wife and children, and rememberest our skill, what feats

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>


Zeus has vouchsafed to us from our fathers' days even until now. 


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.246-8.249"/>For we are not faultless boxers or wrestlers, but in the foot race we run swiftly, and we are the best seamen; and ever to us is the banquet dear, and the lyre, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and warm baths, and the couch.</q></p>

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.250-8.253"/>But come now, all ye that are the best dancers of the Phaeacians, make sport, that the stranger may tell his friends on reaching home how far we surpass others in seamanship and in fleetness of foot, and in the dance and in song. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.254-8.255"/>And let one go straightway

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
and fetch for Demodocus the clear-toned lyre which lies somewhere in our halls.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.256-8.257"/>So spoke Alcinous the godlike, and the herald rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the king. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.258-8.260"/>Then stood up masters of the lists, nine in all, men chosen from out the people, who in their gatherings were wont to order all things aright.

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.261-8.262"/>They levelled a place for the dance, and marked out a fair wide ring, and the herald came near, bearing the clear-toned lyre for Demodocus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.262"/>He then moved into the midst, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.262-8.264"/> and around him stood boys in the first bloom of youth, well skilled in the dance, and they smote the goodly dancing floor with their feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.264-8.265"/>And Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
gazed at the twinklings of their feet and marvelled in spirit.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.266-8.270"/>But the minstrel struck the chords in prelude to his sweet lay and sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite of the fair crown, how first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus secretly; and Ares gave her many gifts, and shamed the bed

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
of the lord Hephaestus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.270-8.271"/>But straightway one came to him with tidings, even Helius, who had marked them as they lay together in love. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.272-8.275"/>And when Hephaestus heard the grievous tale, he went his way to his smithy, pondering evil in the deep of his heart, and set on the anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
which might not be broken or loosed, that the lovers<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> might bide fast where they were. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.276-8.278"/>But when he had fashioned the snare in his wrath against Ares, he went to his chamber where lay his bed, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.279-8.281"/> and everywhere round about the bed-posts he spread the bonds, and many too were hung from above, from the roof-beams,

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
fine as spiders' webs, so that no one even of the blessed gods could see them, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.281"/> so exceeding craftily were they fashioned. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.282-8.284"/>But when he had spread all his snare about the couch, he made as though he would go to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, that well-built citadel, which is in his eyes far the dearest of all lands.

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.285-8.286"/>And no blind watch did Ares of the golden rein keep, when he saw Hephaestus, famed for his handicraft, departing, but he went his way to the house of famous Hephaestus, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.287-8.288"/> eager for the love of Cytherea of the fair crown. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.289-8.290"/>Now she had but newly come from the presence of her father, the mighty son of Cronos,

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>
and had sat her down. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.290-8.291"/>And Ares came into the house and clasped her hand and spoke and addressed her:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.292"/>Come, love, let us to bed and take our joy, couched together. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.293-8.294"/>For Hephaestus is no longer here in the land, but has now gone, I ween, to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, to visit the Sintians of savage speech.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.295"/>So he spoke, and a welcome thing it seemed to her to lie with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.296"/>So they two went to the couch, and lay them down to sleep, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.296-8.298"/> and about them clung the cunning bonds of the wise Hephaestus, nor could they in any wise stir their limbs or raise them up. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.299"/>Then at length they learned that there was no more escaping.

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.300-8.301"/>And near to them came the famous god of the two strong arms,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> having turned back before he reached the land of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.302"/> for Helius had kept watch for him and had brought him word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.303"/>So he went to his house with a heavy heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.305"/>And terribly he cried out and called to all the gods:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.306-8.311"/>Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, come hither that ye may see a laughable matter and a monstrous,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> even how Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, scorns me for that I am lame and loves destructive Ares

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
because he is comely and strong of limb, whereas I was born misshapen. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.311-8.312"/>Yet for this is none other to blame but my two parents—would they had never begotten me! 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.313-8.314"/> But ye shall see where these two have gone up into my bed and sleep together in love; and I am troubled at the sight.

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.315-8.316"/>Yet, methinks, they will not wish to lie longer thus, no, not for a moment, how loving soever they are. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.316-8.317"/>Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.317-8.320"/>
but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave him for the sake of his shameless girl;

for his daughter is fair but bridles not her passion.</q><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.321"/>So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house of the brazen floor.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">3</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.322-8.323"/>Poseidon came, the earth-enfolder, and the helper Hermes came, and the lord Apollo, the archer god.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">4</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.324"/>Now the goddesses abode for shame each in her own house,

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.325"/> but the gods, the givers of good things, stood in the gateway; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.326-8.327"/> and unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods as they saw the craft of wise Hephaestus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.328"/>And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.329"/>Ill deeds thrive not. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.329-8.332"/>The slow catches the swift;

even as now Hephaestus, slow though he is, has out-stripped Ares for all that he is the swiftest of the gods who hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.332"/>Lame though he is, he has caught him by craft, wherefore Ares owes the fine of the adulterer.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.333"/>Thus they spoke to one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.334"/>But to Hermes the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.335-8.337"/>Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger, giver of good things, wouldst thou in sooth be willing, even though ensnared with strong bonds, to lie on a couch by the side of golden Aphrodite?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.338"/>Then the messenger, Argeiphontes, answered him:<q>

Hephaestus, the famous craftsman, to set Ares free;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.349"/>Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.350"/>Ask not this of me, Poseidon, thou earth-enfolder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.354"/>Then again Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.355-8.356"/>Hephaestus, even if Ares shall avoid the debt and flee away, I will myself pay thee this.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.357"/>Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.358"/>It may not be that I should say thee nay, nor were it seemly.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.359"/>So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>
<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.360-8.363"/> and the two, when they were freed from that bond so strong, sprang up straightway. 

And Ares departed to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, but she, the laughter-loving Aphrodite, went to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7002373">Paphos</placeName>,

immortal oil, such as gleams<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> upon the gods that are forever. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.367"/>And they clothed her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.367-8.369"/>This song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus was glad at heart as he listened, and so too were the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.370-8.371"/>Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for no one could vie with them.

would lean backward and toss it toward the shadowy clouds, and the other would leap up from the earth and skilfully catch it before his feet touched the ground again. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.377-8.379"/>But when they had tried their skill in throwing the ball straight up, the two fell to dancing on the bounteous earth, ever tossing the ball to and fro,

stood in the lists and beat time, and thereat a great din arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.385-8.386"/>So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Alcinous was glad; and straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.387"/>Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.388"/>This stranger verily seems to me a man of understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.390-8.391"/> for twelve glorious kings bear sway in our land as rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.396-8.397"/>And let Euryalus make amends to the stranger himself with words and with a gift, for the word that he spoke was in no wise seemly.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.398-8.399"/>So he spoke, and they all praised his words and bade that so it should be, and sent forth every man a herald to fetch the gifts.

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.400"/>And Euryalus in turn made answer, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.403-8.405"/>I will give him this sword, all of bronze, whereon is a hilt of silver, and a scabbard of new-sawn ivory

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.405"/> and it shall be to him a thing of great worth.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.406-8.407"/>So saying, he put into his hands the silver-studded sword, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.408"/>Hail, Sir stranger;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.410-8.411"/>And for thyself, may the gods grant thee to see thy wife, and to come to thy native land, for long time hast thou been suffering woes far from thy friends.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.412"/>And Odysseus of many wiles answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.413"/>All hail to thee, too, friend; and may the gods grant thee happiness, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.414-8.415"/> and mayest thou never hereafter miss

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.416"/>He spoke, and about his shoulders hung the silver-studded sword. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.417"/>And the sun set, and the glorious gifts were brought him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.418"/>These the lordly heralds bore to the palace of Alcinous,

took the beautiful gifts and set them before their honored mother. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.421-8.422"/>And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat down on the high seats. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.423"/>Then to Arete spoke the mighty Alcinous:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.433-8.434"/>So he spoke, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great cauldron on the fire with all speed.

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.435-8.436"/>And they set on the blazing fire the cauldron for filling the bath, and poured in water, and took billets of wood and kindled them beneath it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.437"/>Then the fire played about the belly of the cauldron, and the water grew warm; 


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.438-8.440"/>A but meanwhile Arete brought forth for the stranger a beautiful chest from the treasure chamber, and placed in it the goodly gifts,

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
the raiment and the gold, which the Phaeacians gave. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.441-8.442"/>And therein she herself placed a cloak and a fair tunic; and she spoke and addressed Odysseus with winged words:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.443-8.445"/>Look now thyself to the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it, lest some one despoil thee of thy goods on the way, when later on<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>
thou art lying in sweet sleep, as thou farest in the black ship.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.446-8.448"/>Now when the much-enduring goodly Odysseus heard these words, he straightway fitted on the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it—a cunning knot, which queenly Circe once had taught him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.449-8.450"/>Then forthwith the housewife bade him

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>
go to the bath and bathe; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.450-8.452"/> and his heart was glad when he saw the warm bath, for he had not been wont to have such tendance from the time that he left the house of faired-haired Calypso, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.453"/> but until then he had tendance continually as a god.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.454-8.457"/>Now when the handmaids had bathed him and anointed him with oil,

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>
and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, he came forth from the bath, and went to join the men at their wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.457-8.460"/>And Nausicaa, gifted with beauty by the gods, stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, and she marvelled at Odysseus, as her eyes beheld him,

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.469"/>He spoke, and sat down on a chair beside king Alcinous.

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.470"/>And now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.471-8.472"/>Then the herald came near, leading the good minstrel, Demodocus, held in honor by the people,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.472-8.473"/> and seated him in the midst of the banqueters, leaning his chair against a high pillar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.474-8.476"/>Then to the herald said Odysseus of many wiles,

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>
cutting off a portion of the chine of a white-tusked boar, whereof yet more was left, and there was rich fat on either side:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.477-8.478"/>Herald, take and give this portion to Demodocus, that he may eat,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.478"/> and I will greet him, despite my grief. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.479-8.481"/>For among all men that are upon the earth minstrels

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
win honor and reverence, for that the Muse has taught them the paths of song, and loves the tribe of minstrels.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.482-8.483"/>So he spoke, and the herald bore the portion and placed it in the hands of the lord Demodocus,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.483"/> and he took it and was glad at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.484"/>So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.485-8.486"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then to Demodocus said Odysseus of many wiles:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.487"/>Demodocus, verily above all mortal men do I praise thee, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.488"/> whether it was the Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or Apollo; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.489-8.491"/> for well and truly dost thou sing of the fate of the Achaeans,

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
all that they wrought and suffered, and all the toils they endured, as though haply thou hadst thyself been present, or hadst heard the tale from another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.492-8.495"/>But come now, change thy theme, and sing of the building of the horse of wood, which Epeius made with Athena's help, the horse which once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile,

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>
when he had filled it with the men who sacked <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.496-8.498"/>If thou dost indeed tell me this tale aright, I will declare to all mankind that the god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of divine song.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.499-8.503"/>So he spoke, and the minstrel, moved by the god, began, and let his song be heard,

<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>
taking up the tale where the Argives had embarked on their benched ships and were sailing away, after casting fire on their huts, while those others led by glorious Odysseus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the Trojans, hidden in the horse; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.504"/> for the Trojans had themselves dragged it to the citadel.

<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.505-8.506"/>So there it stood, while the people talked long as they sat about it, and could form no resolve. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.506-8.510"/>Nay, in three ways did counsel find favour in their minds: either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze, or to drag it to the height and cast it down the rocks, or to let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods,

<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>
even as in the end it was to be brought to pass;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.511-8.513"/> for it was their fate to perish when their city should enclose the great horse of wood, wherein were sitting all the best of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and fate. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.514-8.515"/>And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>
poured forth from the horse and, leaving their hollow ambush, sacked the city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.516-8.518"/>Of the others he sang how in divers ways they wasted the lofty city, but of Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house of Deiphobus together with godlike Menelaus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.519-8.520"/>There it was, he said, that Odysseus braved the most terrible fight

<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>
and in the end conquered by the aid of great-hearted Athena.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.523-8.525"/>And as a woman wails and flings herself about her dear husband, who has fallen in front of his city and his people,

<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>
seeking toward off from his city and his children the pitiless day;

<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>
for he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.535"/>And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.536-8.537"/>Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and let Demodocus now check his clear-toned lyre, 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.538"/> for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure with this song. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.539-8.541"/>Ever since we began to sup and the divine minstrel was moved to sing,

<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>
from that time yon stranger has never ceased from sorrowful lamentation; 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.541"/> surely, methinks, grief has encompassed his heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.542-8.543"/>Nay, let the minstrel cease, that we may all make merry, hosts and guest alike, since it is better thus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8.544-8.545"/>Lo, for the sake of the honored stranger all these things have been made ready,

his sending and the gifts of friendship which we give him of our love.

they might reap from season to season harvests exceeding deep, so rich is the soil beneath; and in it, too, is a harbor giving safe anchorage, where there is no need of moorings, either to throw out anchor-stones or to make fast stern cables, but one may beach one's ship and wait until the sailors' minds bid them put out, and the breezes blow fair.

    <p>So saying, I went on board the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose the stern cables.

a high court was built with stones set deep in the earth, and with tall pines and high-crested oaks.

wine sweet and unmixed, a drink divine.

    <q><p>So he spoke, tempting me, but he trapped me not because of my great cunning; and I made answer again in crafty words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>My ship Poseidon, the earth-shaker, dashed to pieces, casting her upon the rocks at the border of your land;

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.285"/>But I, with these men here, escaped utter destruction.</q></p>
    <p>So I spoke, but from his pitiless heart he made no answer, but sprang up and put forth his hands upon my comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.286"/>Two of them at once he seized and dashed to the earth like puppies,

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>
and the brain flowed forth upon the ground and wetted the earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.290"/>Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready his supper, and ate them as a mountain-nurtured lion, leaving naught—ate the entrails, and the flesh, and the marrowy bones. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.291"/>And we with wailing held up our hands to Zeus,

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
beholding his cruel deeds; and helplessness possessed our souls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.296-9.298"/>But when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had filled his huge maw by eating human flesh and thereafter drinking pure milk, he lay down within the cave, stretched out among the sheep. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.299-9.302"/>And I formed a plan in my great heart

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
to steal near him, and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh and smite him in the breast, where the midriff holds the liver, feeling for the place with my hand. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.302"/>But a second thought checked me, for right there should we, too, have perished in utter ruin. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.303"/>For we should not have been able

to thrust back with our hands from the high door the mighty stone which he had set there.

    <p>As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, he rekindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all in turn, and beneath each dam placed her young.

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.310-9.311"/>Then, when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his meal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.312-9.313"/>And when he had made his meal he drove his fat flocks forth from the cave, easily moving away the great door-stone; and then he put it in place again, as one might set the lid upon a quiver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.315-9.316"/>Then with loud whistling the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> turned his fat flocks toward the mountain, and I was left there, devising evil in the deep of my heart, if in any way I might take vengeance on him, and Athena grant me glory.</p></q></p>

    <q><p>Now this seemed to my mind the best plan. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.316-9.317"/>There lay beside a sheep-pen a great club of the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>,

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>
a staff of green olive-wood, which he had cut to carry with him when dry; and as we looked at it we thought it as large as is the mast of a black ship of twenty oars, a merchantman, broad of beam, which crosses over the great gulf; so huge it was in length and in breadth to look upon.

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.325-9.326"/>To this I came, and cut off therefrom about a fathom's length and handed it to my comrades, bidding them dress it down; and they made it smooth, and I, standing by, sharpened it at the point, and then straightway took it and hardened it in the blazing fire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.327"/>Then I laid it carefully away, hiding it beneath the dung,

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>
which lay in great heaps throughout the cave. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.331-9.333"/>And I bade my comrades cast lots among them, which of them should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.334-9.335"/>And the lot fell upon those whom I myself would fain have chosen;

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
four they were, and I was numbered with them as the fifth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.336"/>At even then he came, herding his flocks of goodly fleece, and straightway drove into the wide cave his fat flocks one and all, and left not one without in the deep court, either from some foreboding or because a god so bade him.

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.340-9.342"/>Then he lifted on high and set in place the great door-stone, and sitting down he milked the ewes and bleating goats all in turn, and beneath each dam he placed her young. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.343-9.344"/>But when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his supper.

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.345-9.346"/>Then I drew near and spoke to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, holding in my hands an ivy<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> bowl of the dark wine:
    </p><p><q><placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, take and drink wine after thy meal of human flesh, that thou mayest know what manner of drink this is which our ship contained. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.347-9.349"/>It was to thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering, in the hope that, touched with pity,

thou mightest send me on my way home; but thou ragest in a way that is past all bearing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.350"/>Cruel man, how shall any one of all the multitudes of men ever come to thee again hereafter, seeing that thou hast wrought lawlessness?</q></p>
    <p>So I spoke, and he took the cup and drained it, and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet draught, and asked me for it again a second time:</p><p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.355-9.356"/>Give it me again with a ready heart, and tell me thy name straightway, that I may give thee a stranger's gift whereat thou mayest be glad. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.357-9.358"/>For among the Cyclopes the earth, the giver of grain, bears the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase; but this is a streamlet of ambrosia and nectar.</q></p></q></p>

<q><p>So he spoke, and again I handed him the flaming wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.360"/>Thrice I brought and gave it him, and thrice he drained it in his folly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.361"/>But when the wine had stolen about the wits of the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, then I spoke to him with gentle words:</p><p>
    <q><placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, thou askest me of my glorious name, and I

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.366"/>So I spoke, and he straightway answered me with pitiless heart: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.366-9.367"/>Noman will I eat last among his comrades,

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
and the others before him; this shall be thy gift.</q></p>
    <p>He spoke, and reeling fell upon his back, and lay there with his thick neck bent aslant, and sleep, that conquers all, laid hold on him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.370"/>And from his gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh, and he vomited in his drunken sleep.

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.375-9.376"/>Then verily I thrust in the stake under the deep ashes until it should grow hot, and heartened all my comrades with cheering words, that I might see no man flinch through fear. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.376-9.377"/>But when presently that stake of olive-wood was about to catch fire, green though it was, and began to glow terribly,

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
then verily I drew nigh, bringing the stake from the fire, and my comrades stood round me and a god breathed into us great courage. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.381"/>They took the stake of olive-wood, sharp at the point, and thrust it into his eye, while I, throwing my weight upon it from above, whirled it round, as when a man bores a ship's timber

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
with a drill, while those below keep it spinning with the thong, which they lay hold of by either end, and the drill runs around unceasingly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.387-9.388"/>Even so we took the fiery-pointed stake and whirled it around in his eye, and the blood flowed around the heated thing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.389-9.390"/>And his eyelids wholly and his brows round about did the flame singe

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
as the eyeball burned, and its roots crackled in the fire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.391-9.393"/>And as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing to temper it—for therefrom comes the strength of iron—even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olive-wood.

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.395-9.396"/>Terribly then did he cry aloud, and the rock rang around; and we, seized with terror, shrank back, while he wrenched from his eye the stake, all befouled with blood, and flung it from him, wildly waving his arms. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.396-9.397"/>Then he called aloud to the Cyclopes, who

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
dwelt round about him in caves among the windy heights, and they heard his cry and came thronging from every side, and standing around the cave asked him what ailed him:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.401-9.402"/>What so sore distress is thine, Polyphemus, that thou criest out thus through the immortal night, and makest us sleepless?

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.405"/>Can it be that some mortal man is driving off thy flocks against thy will, or slaying thee thyself by guile or by might?</q></p>
    <p>Then from out the cave the mighty Polyphemus answered them: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.406"/>My friends, it is Noman that is slaying me by guile and not by force.</q></p></q></p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
    <q><p>And they made answer and addressed him with winged words:

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.410-9.412"/>If, then, no man does violence to thee in thy loneliness, sickness which comes from great Zeus thou mayest in no wise escape. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.413-9.414"/>Nay, do thou pray to our father, the lord Poseidon.</q></p>
    <p>So they spoke and went their way; and my heart laughed within me that my name and cunning device had so beguiled.

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.415-9.418"/>But the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, groaning and travailing in anguish, groped with his hands and took away the stone from the door, and himself sat in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the sheep—so witless, forsooth, he thought in his heart to find me.

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.420-9.422"/>But I took counsel how all might be the very best, if I might haply find some way of escape from death for my comrades and for myself. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.422-9.423"/>And I wove all manner of wiles and counsel, as a man will in a matter of life and death; for great was the evil that was nigh us. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.423"/>And this seemed to my mind the best plan.

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.425-9.426"/>Rams there were, well-fed and thick of fleece, fine beasts and large, with wool dark as the violet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.427-9.429"/>These I silently bound together with twisted withes on which the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, that monster with his heart set on lawlessness, was wont to sleep. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.429-9.430"/>Three at a time I took. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>The one in the middle in each case bore a man,

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>
and the other two went, one on either side, saving my comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.431"/>Thus every three sheep bore a man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.431-9.434"/>But as for me—there was a ram, far the best of all the flock; him I grasped by the back, and curled beneath his shaggy belly, lay there face upwards

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>
with steadfast heart, clinging fast with my hands to his wondrous fleece. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.436"/>So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright dawn.</p>
    <p>As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture and the females bleated unmilked about the pens,

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
for their udders were bursting. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.440"/>And their master, distressed with grievous pains, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him, but in his folly he marked not this, that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.440-9.442"/>Last of all the flock the ram went forth,

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>
burdened with the weight of his fleece and my cunning self. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.446"/>And mighty Polyphemus, as he felt along his back, spoke to him, saying:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.447-9.448"/>Good ram, why pray is it that thou goest forth thus through the cave the last of the flock? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.448-9.452"/>Thou hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the sheep, but wast ever far the first to feed on the tender bloom of the grass,

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>
moving with long strides, and ever the first didst reach the streams of the river, and the first didst long to return to the fold at evening. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.452"/>But now thou art last of all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.452-9.455"/>Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master, which an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows, when he had overpowered my wits with wine,

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>
even Noman, who, I tell thee, has not yet escaped destruction. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.456-9.457"/>If only thou couldst feel as I do, and couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where he skulks away from my wrath, then should his brains be dashed on the ground here and there throughout the cave, when I had smitten him, and my heart

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
should be lightened of the woes which good-for-naught Noman has brought me.</q></p></q></p>

                        <p>
    <q><p>So saying, he sent the ram forth from him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.461"/>And when we had gone a little way from the cave and the court, I first loosed myself from under the ram and set my comrades free. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.462-9.463"/>Speedily then we drove off those long-shanked sheep, rich with fat,

<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>
turning full often to look about until we came to the ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.466-9.467"/>And welcome to our dear comrades was the sight of us who had escaped death, but for the others they wept and wailed; yet I would not suffer them to weep, but with a frown forbade each man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.468-9.470"/>Rather I bade them

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>
to fling on board with speed the many sheep of goodly fleece, and sail over the salt water. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.471-9.472"/>So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.473-9.474"/>But when I was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, then I spoke to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> with mocking words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>
<q><placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, that man, it seems, was no weakling, whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by brutal strength in thy hollow cave. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.475-9.476"/>Full surely were thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head, thou cruel wretch, who didst not shrink from eating thy guests in thine own house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.477-9.479"/>Therefore has Zeus taken vengeance on thee, and the other gods.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.480-9.484"/>So I spoke, and he waxed the more wroth at heart, and broke off the peak of a high mountain and hurled it at us, and cast it in front of the dark-prowed ship.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell,

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>
and the backward flow, like a flood from the deep, bore the ship swiftly landwards and drove it upon the shore. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.485-9.486"/>But I seized a long pole in my hands and shoved the ship off and along the shore,

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
and with a nod of my head I roused my comrades, and bade them fall to their oars that we might escape out of our evil plight. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.490"/>And they bent to their oars and rowed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.491-9.492"/>But when, as we fared over the sea, we were twice as far distant, then was I fain to call to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, though round about me my comrades, one after another, sought to check me with gentle words:</p><p>

<q><p>So they spoke, but they could not persuade my great-hearted spirit; and I answered him again with angry heart:</p><p>

and grew old as a seer among the Cyclopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.513-9.514"/>But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to come hither, clothed in great might,

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>
but now one that is puny, a man of naught and a weakling, has blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me with wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:9.515-9.516"/>Yet come hither, Odysseus, that I may set before thee gifts of entertainment, and may speed thy sending hence, that the glorious Earth-shaker may grant it thee.

<p>So I spoke and addressed them with gentle words, but they were silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.117"/>Then he raised a cry throughout the city, and as they heard it the mighty Laestrygonians came thronging from all sides,

in the halls of Circe, through the thick brush and the wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.156-10.159"/>But when, as I went, I was near to the curved ship, then some god took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a great, high-horned stag into my very path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.226-10.228"/>Friends, within someone goes to and fro before a great web, singing sweetly, so that all the floor echoes; some goddess it is, or some woman. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.228"/>Come, let us quickly call to her.</q></p>
    <p>So he spoke, and they cried aloud, and called to her.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.230-10.231"/>And she straightway came forth and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and all went with her in their folly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.231"/>Only Eurylochus remained behind, for he suspected that there was a snare. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.232"/>She brought them in and made them sit on chairs and seats, and made for them a potion of cheese and barley meal and yellow honey

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
with Pramnian wine; but in the food she mixed baneful drugs, that they might utterly forget their native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.235-10.236"/>Now when she had given them the potion, and they had drunk it off, then she presently smote them with her wand, and penned them in the sties. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.237-10.238"/>And they had the heads, and voice, and bristles,

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
and shape of swine, but their minds remained unchanged even as before. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.241-10.243"/>So they were penned there weeping, and before them Circe flung mast and acorns, and the fruit of the cornel tree, to eat, such things as wallowing swine are wont to feed upon.</p>
    <p>But Eurylochus came back straightway to the swift, black ship,

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
to bring tiding of his comrades and their shameful doom. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.246-10.247"/>Not a word could he utter, for all his desire, so stricken to the heart was he with great distress, and his eyes were filled with tears, and his spirit was set on lamentation. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.247-10.248"/>But when we questioned him in amazement,

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
then he told the fate of the others, his comrades.</p>
    <p><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.251"/>We went through the thickets, as thou badest, noble Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.252-10.253"/>We found in the forest glades a fair palace, built of polished stones, in a place of wide outlook. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.254-10.255"/>There someone was going to and fro before a great web, and singing with clear voice,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
some goddess or some woman, and they cried aloud, and called to her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.255"/>And she came forth straightway, and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and they all went with her in their folly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.256-10.257"/>But I remained behind, for I suspected that there was a snare. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.257"/>Then they all vanished together, nor did one of them

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
appear again, though I sat long and watched.</q></p></q></p>

                        <p>
    <q><p>So he spoke, and I cast my silver-studded sword about my shoulders, a great sword of bronze, and slung my bow about me, and bade him lead me back by the self-same road. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.260"/>But he clasped me with both hands, and be sought me by my knees,

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
and with wailing he spoke to me winged words:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.266"/>Lead me not thither against my will, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me here. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.267-10.268"/>For I know that thou wilt neither come back thyself, nor bring anyone of thy comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.268-10.269"/>Nay, with these that are here let us flee with all speed, for still we may haply escape the evil day.</q></p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
<p>So he spoke, but I answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.270"/>Eurylochus, do thou stay here in this place, eating and drinking by the hollow, black ship; but I will go, for strong necessity is laid upon me.</q></p>
    <p>So saying, I went up from the ship and the sea.

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.275-10.279"/>But when, as I went through the sacred glades, I was about to come to the great house of the sorceress, Circe, then Hermes, of the golden wand, met me as I went toward the house, in the likeness of a young man with the first down upon his lip, in whom the charm of youth is fairest.

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.280"/>He clasped my hand, and spoke, and addressed me:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.281-10.282"/>Whither now again, hapless man, dost thou go alone through the hills, knowing naught of the country? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.282-10.283"/>Lo, thy comrades yonder in the house of Circe are penned like swine in close-barred sties. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.284"/>And art thou come to release them? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.284-10.285"/>Nay, I tell thee, thou shalt not

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>
thyself return, but shalt remain there with the others. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.286"/>But come, I will free thee from harm, and save thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.287-10.288"/>Here, take this potent herb, and go to the house of Circe, and it shall ward off from thy head the evil day. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.289"/>And I will tell thee all the baneful wiles of Circe.

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.290"/>She will mix thee a potion, and cast drugs into the food; but even so she shall not be able to bewitch thee, for the potent herb that I shall give thee will not suffer it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.291"/>And I will tell thee all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.291-10.292"/>When Circe shall smite thee with her long wand, then do thou draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh,

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
and rush upon Circe, as though thou wouldst slay her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.296"/>And she will be seized with fear, and will bid thee lie with her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.297-10.298"/>Then do not thou thereafter refuse the couch of the goddess, that she may set free thy comrades, and give entertainment to thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.299-10.301"/>But bid her swear a great oath by the blessed gods,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
that she will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt, lest when she has thee stripped she may render thee a weakling and unmanned.</q></p></q></p>

                        <p>
    <q><p>So saying, Argeiphontes gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.302-10.303"/>At the root it was black, but its flower was like milk.

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.305"/>Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for mortal men to dig; but with the gods all things are possible. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.305-10.306"/>Hermes then departed to high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> through the wooded isle, and I went my way to the house of Circe, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went.

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.310"/>So I stood at the gates of the fair-tressed goddess. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.311"/>There I stood and called, and the goddess heard my voice. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.312-10.313"/>Straightway then she came forth, and opened the bright doors, and bade me in; and I went with her, my heart sore troubled. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.313"/>She brought me in and made me sit on a silver-studded chair,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>
a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.315"/>And she prepared me a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink, and put therein a drug, with evil purpose in her heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.316-10.317"/>But when she had given it me, and I had drunk it off, yet was not bewitched, she smote me with her wand, and spoke, and addressed me:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.320"/>Begone now to the sty, and lie with the rest of thy comrades.</q></p>
    <p>So she spoke, but I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my thigh, rushed upon Circe, as though I would slay her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.321-10.322"/>But she, with a loud cry, ran beneath, and clasped my knees, and with wailing she spoke to me winged words:</p><p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.325"/>Who art thou among men, and from whence? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.325"/>Where is thy city, and where thy parents? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.326"/>Amazement holds me that thou hast drunk this charm and wast in no wise bewitched. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.327-10.328"/>For no man else soever hath withstood this charm, when once he has drunk it, and it has passed the barrier of his teeth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.329"/>Nay, but the mind in thy breast is one not to be beguiled.

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.330-10.332"/>Surely thou art Odysseus, the man of ready device, who Argeiphontes of the golden wand ever said to me would come hither on his way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with his swift, black ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.333-10.335"/>Nay, come, put up thy sword in its sheath, and let us two then go up into my bed, that couched together

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
in love we may put trust in each other.</q></p>
    <p>So she spoke, but I answered her, and said:  <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.336"/>Circe, how canst thou bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my comrades into swine in thy halls, and now keepest me here, and with guileful purpose biddest me

go to thy chamber, and go up into thy bed, that when thou hast me stripped thou mayest render me a weakling and unmanned? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.342-10.344"/>Nay, verily, it is not I that shall be fain to go up into thy bed, unless thou, goddess, wilt consent to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.</q></p></q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.345"/>So I spoke, and she straightway swore the oath to do me no harm, as I bade her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.346-10.347"/>But when she had sworn, and made an end of the oath, then I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe.</p>
    <p>But her handmaids meanwhile were busied in the halls, four maidens who are her serving-women in the house.

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.350-10.351"/>Children are they of the springs and groves, and of the sacred rivers that flow forth to the sea, and of them one threw upon chairs fair rugs of purple above, and spread beneath them a linen cloth; another drew up before the chairs tables

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
of silver, and set upon them golden baskets; and the third mixed sweet, honey-hearted wine in a bowl of silver, and served out golden cups; and the fourth brought water, and kindled a great fire beneath a large cauldron, and the water grew warm.

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.360-10.363"/>But when the water boiled in the bright bronze, she set me in a bath, and bathed me with water from out the great cauldron, mixing it to my liking, and pouring it over my head and shoulders, till she took from my limbs soul-consuming weariness. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.364-10.367"/>But when she had bathed me, and anointed me richly with oil,

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>
and had cast about me a fair cloak and a tunic, she brought me into the hall, and made me sit upon a silver-studded chair—a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.368-10.370"/>Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
for me to wash, and beside me drew up a polished table. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.370"/>And the grave housewife brought and set before me bread, and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.371-10.372"/>Then she bade me eat, but my heart inclined not thereto. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.373"/>Rather, I sat with other thoughts, and my spirit boded ill.</p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
<p>Now when Circe noted that I sat thus, and did not put forth my hands to the food, but was burdened with sore grief, she came close to me, and spoke winged words:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.375-10.377"/>Why, Odysseus, dost thou sit thus like one that is dumb, eating thy heart, and dost not touch food or drink?

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.380"/>Dost thou haply forbode some other guile? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.380-10.381"/>Nay, thou needest in no wise fear, for already have I sworn a mighty oath to do thee no harm.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.381"/>So she spoke, but I answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.382"/>Circe, what man that is right-minded could bring himself to taste of food or drink,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
ere yet he had won freedom for his comrades, and beheld them before his face? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.386-10.387"/>But if thou of a ready heart dost bid me eat and drink, set them free, that mine eyes may behold my trusty comrades.</q></p></q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:10.388-10.427">
                        <p>
    <q><p>So I spoke, and Circe went forth through the hall holding her wand in her hand, and opened the doors of the sty,

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
and drove them out in the form of swine of nine years old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.391-10.392"/>So they stood there before her, and she went through the midst of them, and anointed each man with another charm. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.393-10.394"/>Then from their limbs the bristles fell away which the baneful drug that queenly Circe gave them had before made to grow,

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
and they became men again, younger than they were before, and far comelier and taller to look upon. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.395-10.396"/>They knew me, and clung to my hands, each man of them, and upon them all came a passionate sobbing, and the house about them rang wondrously, and the goddess herself was moved to pity.</p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
<p>Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.400"/>Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, go now to thy swift ship and to the shore of the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.401-10.402"/>First of all do ye draw the ship up on the land, and store your goods and all the tackling in caves.

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.405"/>Then come back thyself, and bring thy trusty comrades.</q></p>
    <p>So she spoke, and my proud heart consented. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.406-10.407"/>I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and there I found my trusty comrades by the swift ship, wailing piteously, shedding big tears.

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.410-10.412"/>And as when calves in a farmstead sport about the droves of cows returning to the yard, when they have had their fill of grazing—all together they frisk before them, and the pens no longer hold them, but with constant lowing they run about their mothers—so those men, when their eyes beheld me,

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
thronged about me weeping, and it seemed to their hearts as though they had got to their native land, and the very city of rugged <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where they were bred and born. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.415-10.417"/>And with wailing they spoke to me winged words:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.418"/>At thy return, O thou fostered of Zeus, we are as glad

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
as though we had returned to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, our native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.421"/>But come, tell the fate of the others, our comrades.</q></p>
    <p>So they spoke, and I answered them with gentle words: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.422"/>First of all let us draw the ship up on the land, and store our goods and all the tackling in caves.

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.425-10.427"/>Then haste you, one and all, to go with me that you may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe, drinking and eating, for they have unfailing store.</q></p></q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:10.428-10.474">
                        <p>
    <q><p>So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.427"/>Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all my comrades,

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>
 and he spoke, and addressed them with winged words:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.430"/>Ah, wretched men, whither are we going? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.431"/>Why are you so enamoured of these woes, as to go down to the house of Circe, who will change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, that so we may guard her great house perforce?

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.437"/>Even so did the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, when our comrades went to his fold, and with them went this reckless Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.438-10.441"/>For it was through this man's folly that they too perished.</q></p>
<p>So he spoke, and I pondered in heart, whether to draw my long sword from beside my stout thigh,

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
and therewith strike off his head, and bring it to the ground, near kinsman of mine by marriage though he was; but my comrades one after another sought to check me with gentle words:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.441-10.442"/>O thou sprung from Zeus, as for this man, we will leave him, if thou so biddest, to abide here by the ship, and to guard the ship,

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>
but as for us, do thou lead us to the sacred house of Circe.</q></p>
    <p>So saying, they went up from the ship and the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.445"/>Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared my dread reproof.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile in her halls Circe

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>
bathed the rest of my comrades with kindly care, and anointed them richly with oil, and cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics; and we found them all feasting bountifully in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.452"/>But when they saw and recognized one another, face to face, they wept and wailed, and the house rang around.

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.455"/>Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.456"/>No longer now do ye rouse this plenteous lamenting. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.456-10.458"/>Of myself I know both all the woes you have suffered on the teeming deep, and all the wrong that cruel men have done you on the land.

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.460-10.463"/>Nay, come, eat food and drink wine, until you once more get spirit in your breasts such as when at the first you left your native land of rugged <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but now ye are withered and spiritless, ever thinking of your weary wanderings, nor are your

    <p>So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.466"/>So there day after day for a full year we abode, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:10.467-10.468"/>But when a year was gone and the seasons turned,

as the months waned and the long days were brought in their course, then my trusty comrades called me forth, and said:</p><p>

    <p>But the other cliff, thou wilt note, Odysseus, is lower—they are close to each other; thou couldst even shoot an arrow across—and on it is a great fig tree with rich foliage, but beneath this divine Charybdis sucks down the black water.

<p>So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess answered and said: <q><p>Rash man, lo, now again thy heart is set on the deeds of war and on toil.

there is no defence; to flee from her is bravest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.131-12.133"/>These their honored mother, when she had borne and reared them,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.152"/>Friends, since it is not right that one or two alone should know

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
the oracles that Circe, the beautiful goddess, told me, therefore will I tell them, in order that knowing them we may either die or, shunning death and fate, escape. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.156-12.157"/>First she bade us avoid the voice of the wondrous Sirens, and their flowery meadow.

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.160"/>Me alone she bade to listen to their voice; but do ye bind me with grievous bonds, that I may abide fast where I am, upright in the step of the mast, and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself; and if I implore and bid you to loose me, then do ye tie me fast with yet more bonds.</q></p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
<p>Thus I rehearsed all these things and told them to my comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.165"/>Meanwhile the well-built ship speedily came to the isle of the two Sirens, for a fair and gentle wind bore her on. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.166-12.167"/>Then presently the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and a god lulled the waves to sleep.

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.170-12.172"/>But my comrades rose up and furled the sail and stowed it in the hollow ship, and thereafter sat at the oars and made the water white with their polished oars of fir. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.173-12.174"/>But I with my sharp sword cut into small bits a great round cake of wax, and kneaded it with my strong hands,

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
and soon the wax grew warm, forced by the strong pressure and the rays of the lord Helios Hyperion.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.175-12.176"/>Then I anointed with this the ears of all my comrades in turn; and they bound me in the ship hand and foot, upright in the step of the mast, and made the ropes fast at the ends to the mast itself;

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
and themselves sitting down smote the grey sea with their oars. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.180"/>But when we were as far distant as a man can make himself heard when he shouts, driving swiftly on our way, the Sirens failed not to note the swift ship as it drew near, and they raised their clear-toned song:</p><p>

                        <p>
    <q><p>So they spoke, sending forth their beautiful voice, and my heart was fain to listen, and I bade my comrades loose me, nodding to them with my brows; but they fell to their oars and rowed on.

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.195-12.196"/>And presently Perimedes and Eurylochus arose and bound me with yet more bonds and drew them tighter.

    <p>But when we had left the island, I presently saw smoke and a great billow, and heard a booming.

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
the ship stood still where it was, when they no longer plied with their hands the tapering oars. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.206-12.207"/>But I went through the ship and cheered my men with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn:
    <q>‘Friends, hitherto we have been in no wise ignorant of sorrow; surely this evil that besets us now is no greater than when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
penned us in his hollow cave by brutal strength; yet even thence we made our escape through my valor and counsel and wit; these dangers, too, methinks we shall some day remember. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.211-12.212"/>But now come, as I bid, let us all obey. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.213"/>Do you keep your seats on the benches

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
and smite with your oars the deep surf of the sea, in the hope that Zeus may grant us to escape and avoid this death. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.217"/>And to thee, steersman, I give this command, and do thou lay it to heart, since thou wieldest the steering oar of the hollow ship.

the ship well away and hug the cliff, lest, ere thou know it, the ship swerve off to the other side and thou cast us into destruction.</q></p>
<p>So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.222"/>But of Scylla I went not on to speak, a cureless bane, lest haply my comrades, seized with fear, should cease

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
from rowing and huddle together in the hold. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.226-12.227"/>Then verily I forgot the hard command of Circe, whereas she bade me in no wise to arm myself; but when I had put on my glorious armour and grasped in my hand two long spears, I went to the fore-deck of the ship,

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
whence I deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring ruin upon my comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.230-12.231"/>But nowhere could I descry her, and my eyes grew weary as I gazed everywhere toward the misty rock.</p></q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.235-12.236"/>For on one side lay Scylla and on the other divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water of the sea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.237-12.239"/>Verily whenever she belched it forth, like a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe and bubble in utter turmoil, and high over head the spray would fall on the tops of both the cliffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.243"/>So we looked toward her and feared destruction;

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
but meanwhile Scylla seized from out the hollow ship six of my comrades who were the best in strength and in might. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.245-12.246"/>Turning my eyes to the swift ship and to the company of my men,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> even then I noted above me their feet and hands as they were raised aloft. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.247-12.249"/>To me they cried aloud, calling upon me

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
by name for that last time in anguish of heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.251-12.255"/>And as a fisher on a jutting rock, when he casts in his baits as a snare to the little fishes, with his long pole lets down into the sea the horn of an ox of the steading,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and then as he catches a fish flings it writhing ashore,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
even so were they drawn writhing up towards the cliffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.258-12.259"/>Most piteous did mine eyes behold that thing of all that I bore while I explored the paths of the sea.</p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
<p>Now when we had escaped the rocks, and dread Charybdis and Scylla, presently then we came to the goodly island of the god, where were the fair kine, broad of brow, and the many goodly flocks of Helios Hyperion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.266-12.269"/>I heard the lowing of the cattle that were being stalled and the bleating of the sheep, and upon my mind fell the words of the blind seer, Theban Teiresias, and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to mortals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.270"/>Then verily I spoke among my comrades, grieved at heart:</p><p>

<p>So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent.

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.295-12.296"/>Then verily I knew that some god was assuredly devising ill, and I spoke and addressed him with winged words:</p><p>

no man may slay either cow or sheep in the blind folly of his mind; but be content to eat the food which immortal Circe gave.</q></p>
<p>So I spoke; and they straightway swore that they would not, even as I bade them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.301-12.302"/>But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath,

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>
we moored our well-built ship in the hollow harbor near a spring of sweet water, and my comrades went forth from the ship and skilfully made ready their supper. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.308-12.310"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then they fell to weeping, as they remembered their dear comrades

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.311"/>But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, roused against us a fierce wind with a wondrous tempest, and hid with clouds

the land and sea alike, and night rushed down from heaven. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:12.315"/>And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we dragged our ship, and made her fast in a hollow cave, where were the fair dancing-floors and seats of the nymphs.

<q>‘Friends, in our swift ship is meat and drink; let us therefore keep our hands from those kine lest we come to harm, for these are the cows and goodly sheep of a dread god, even of Helios, who oversees all things and overhears all things.</q></p>
<p>So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented.

and now they must needs roam about in search of game, fishes, and fowl, and whatever might come to their hands—fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their bellies—then I went apart up the island that I might pray to the gods in the hope that one of them might show me a way to go.

rather would I lose my life once for all with a gulp at the wave, than pine slowly away in a desert isle.</q></p>
<p>So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.165-13.166"/>But they spoke winged words to one another, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.167"/>And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.168-13.169"/>Ah me, who has now bound our swift ship on the sea as she sped homeward? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.169"/>Lo, she was in plain sight.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.170"/>So would one of them speak, but they knew not how these things were to be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.170"/>Then Alcinous addressed their company and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.171"/>Lo now, verily the oracles of my father, uttered long ago, have come upon me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.172-13.174"/>He was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men.

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.175-13.177"/>He said that some day, as a beautiful ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon would smite her, and would fling a great mountain about our town. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.178"/>So that old man spoke, and lo, now all this is being brought to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.178"/>But now come, as I bid let us all obey.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.180-13.181"/>Cease ye to give convoy to mortals, when anyone comes to our city, and let us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if haply he may take pity, and not fling a lofty mountain about our town.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.181-13.183"/>So he spoke, and they were seized with fear and made ready the bulls.

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.185-13.187"/>Thus they were praying to the lord Poseidon, the leaders and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as they stood about the altar, but Odysseus awoke out of his sleep in his native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.187-13.189"/>Yet he knew it not after his long absence, for about him the goddess had shed a mist,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
even Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, that she might render him unknown, and tell him all things, so that his wife might not know him, nor his townsfolk, nor his friends, until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgressions. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.194-13.196"/>Therefore all things seemed strange to their lord,

the long paths, the bays offering safe anchorage, the sheer cliffs, and the luxuriant trees. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.197"/>So he sprang up and stood and looked upon his native land, and then he groaned and smote both of his thighs with the flat of his hands, and mournfully spoke, and said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.200"/>Woe is me, to the land of what mortals am I now come? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.201-13.202"/>Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust, or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.203"/>Whither shall I bear all this wealth, or whither shall I myself go wandering on? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.203-13.204"/>Would that I had remained there among the Phaeacians,

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
and had then come to some other of the mighty kings, who would have entertained me and sent me on my homeward way. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.205-13.206"/>But now I know not where to bestow this wealth; yet here will I not leave it, lest haply it become the spoil of others to my cost. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.207-13.208"/>Out upon them; not wholly wise, it seems, nor just

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
were the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians who have brought me to a strange land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.213-13.214"/>Verily they said that they would bring me to clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, but they have not made good their word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>May Zeus, the suppliant's god, requite them, who watches over all men, and punishes him that sins.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.215-13.216"/>But come, I will number the goods, and go over them, lest to my cost these men have carried off aught with them in the hollow ship.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.217-13.218"/>So he spake, and set him to count the beautiful tripods, and the cauldrons, and the gold, and the fair woven raiment, and of these he missed nothing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.219"/>Then, mournfully longing for his native land,

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
he paced by the shore of the loud-sounding sea, uttering many a moan. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.221-13.224"/>And Athena drew near him in the form of a young man, a herdsman of sheep, one most delicate, as are the sons of princes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>In a double fold about her shoulders she wore a well-wrought cloak,

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
and beneath her shining feet she had sandals, and in her hands a spear. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.225"/>Then Odysseus was glad at sight of her, and came to meet her, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
    <q>

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.230-13.231"/>Nay, save this treasure, and save me; for to thee do I pray, as to a god, and am come to thy dear knees. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.232"/>And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.233"/>What land, what people is this? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.234-13.235"/>What men dwell here? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Is it some clear-seen island, or a shore

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
of the deep-soiled mainland that lies resting on the sea?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.236"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.237-13.238"/>A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from far, if indeed thou askest of this land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.238-13.239"/>Surely it is no wise so nameless, but full many know it,

both all those who dwell toward the dawn and the sun, and all those that are behind toward the murky darkness. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.242-13.243"/>It is a rugged isle, not fit for driving horses, yet it is not utterly poor, though it be but narrow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.244-13.245"/>Therein grows corn beyond measure, and the wine-grape as well,

and the rain never fails it, nor the rich dew. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.245"/>It is a good land for pasturing goats and kine; there are trees of every sort, and in it also pools for watering that fail not the year through. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.246"/>Therefore, stranger, the name of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> has reached even to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> which, they say, is far from this land of Achaea.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.250-13.252"/>So she spake, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, and rejoiced in his land, the land of his fathers, as he heard the word of Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words; yet he spoke not the truth, but checked the word ere it was uttered,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
ever revolving in his breast thoughts of great cunning:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.256-13.257"/>I heard of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, even in broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, far over the sea; and now have I myself come hither with these my goods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.257-13.258"/>And I left as much more with my children, when I fled the land, after I had slain the dear son of Idomeneus,

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> surpassed in fleetness all men that live by toil. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Now he would have robbed me of all that booty of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, for which I had borne grief of heart, passing through wars of men and the grievous waves,

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
for that I would not shew favour to his father, and serve as his squire in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other men of my own. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.267-13.268"/>So I smote him with my bronze-tipped spear as he came home from the field, lying in wait for him with one of my men by the roadside. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.269-13.270"/>A dark night covered the heavens, and no

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
man was ware of us, but unseen I took away his life. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.271-13.273"/>Now when I had slain him with the sharp bronze, I went straightway to a ship, and made prayer to the lordly Phoenicians, giving them booty to satisfy their hearts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.274-13.275"/>I bade them take me aboard and land me at <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>,

or at goodly <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans hold sway. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.276-13.277"/>Yet verily the force of the wind thrust them away from thence, sore against their will, nor did they purpose to play me false; but driven wandering from thence we came hither by night. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.278"/>With eager haste we rowed on into the harbor, nor had we any

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
thought of supper, sore as was our need of it, but even as we were we went forth from the ship and lay down, one and all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.282-13.284"/>Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, but they took my goods out of the hollow ship and set them where I myself lay on the sands.

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.285-13.286"/>And they went on board, and departed for the well-peopled land of <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName>; but I was left here, my heart sore troubled.</q></p>

and deceitful tales, which thou lovest from the bottom of thine heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.296-13.299"/>But come, let us no longer talk of this, being both well versed in craft, since thou art far the best of all men in counsel and in speech, and I among all the gods am famed for wisdom and craft. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.299-13.307"/>Yet thou didst not know

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, even me, who ever stand by thy side, and guard thee in all toils. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Aye, and I made thee beloved by all the Phaeacians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And now am I come hither to weave a plan with thee, and to hide all the treasure, which the lordly Phaeacians

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>
gave thee by my counsel and will, when thou didst set out for home; and to tell thee all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil in thy well-built house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.307-13.310"/>But do thou be strong, for bear it thou must, and tell no man of them all nor any woman that thou hast come back from thy wanderings, but in silence

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
endure thy many griefs, and submit to the violence of men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.311"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.312-13.313"/>Hard is it, goddess, for a mortal man to know thee when he meets thee, how wise soever he be, for thou takest what shape thou wilt. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.313"/>But this I know well, that of old thou wast kindly toward me,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>
so long as we sons of the Achaeans were warring in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.316-13.319"/>But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, never since then have I seen thee, daughter of Zeus, nor marked thee coming on board my ship, that thou mightest ward off sorrow from me.

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.320-13.321"/>Nay, I ever wandered on, bearing in my breast a stricken heart, till the gods delivered me from evil, even until in the rich land of the Phaeacians thou didst cheer me with thy words, and thyself lead me to their city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.322-13.323"/>But now I beseech thee by thy father—for I think not

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
that I am come to clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; nay, it is some other land over which I roam, and thou, methinks, dost speak thus in mockery to beguile my mind—tell me whether in very truth I am come to my dear native land.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.330"/>Ever such is the thought in thy breast, and therefore it is that I cannot leave thee in thy sorrow, for thou art soft of speech, keen of wit, and prudent.

but thou art not yet minded to know or learn of aught, till thou hast furthermore proved thy wife, who abides as of old in her halls, and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and days wane, as she weeps. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.335-13.338"/>But as for me, I never doubted of this, but in my heart

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>
knew it well, that thou wouldest come home after losing all thy comrades. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.341-13.343"/>Yet, thou must know, I was not minded to strive against Poseidon, my father's brother, who laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.344"/>But come, I will shew thee the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that thou mayest be sure.

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.345-13.346"/>This is the harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and here at the head of the harbor is the long-leafed olive tree, and near it is the pleasant, shadowy cave, sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.347-13.348"/>This, thou must know, is the vaulted cave in which thou

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.351"/>So spake the goddess, and scattered the mist, and the land appeared. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.352"/>Glad then was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, rejoicing in his own land, and he kissed the earth, the giver of grain.

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.355"/>And straightway he prayed to the nymphs with upstretched hands:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.356-13.357"/>Ye Naiad Nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to behold you again, but now I hail you with loving prayers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.357-13.358"/>Aye, and gifts too will I give, as aforetime, if the daughter of Zeus, she that drives the spoil, shall graciously grant me

to live, and shall bring to manhood my dear son.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.361"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him again: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.362"/>Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.363-13.364"/>But let us now forthwith set thy goods in the innermost recess of the wondrous cave, where they may abide for thee in safety,

and let us ourselves take thought how all may be far the best.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.365"/>So saying, the goddess entered the shadowy cave and searched out its hiding-places. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.366-13.367"/>And Odysseus brought all the treasure thither, the gold and the stubborn bronze and the finely-wrought raiment, which the Phaeacians gave him.

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.370-13.371"/>These things he carefully laid away, and Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, set a stone at the door. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.372-13.373"/>Then the two sat them down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised death for the insolent wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.374"/>And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.379-13.381"/>And she, as she mournfully looks for thy coming,

offers hopes to all, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.382"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.383-13.385"/>Lo now, of a surety I was like to have perished in my halls by the evil fate of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,

hadst not thou, goddess, duly told me all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.393-13.394"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.394-13.396"/>Yea verily, I will be with thee, and will not forget thee, when we are busied with this work; and methinks many a one

of the wooers that devour thy substance shall bespatter the vast earth with his blood and brains. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.397"/>But come, I will make thee unknown to all mortals. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.398-13.403"/>I will shrivel the fair skin on thy supple limbs, and destroy the flaxen hair from off thy head, and clothe thee in a ragged garment,

such that one would shudder to see a man clad therein. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.404-13.406"/>And I will dim thy two eyes that were before so beautiful, that thou mayest appear mean in the sight of all the wooers, and of thy wife, and of thy son, whom thou didst leave in thy halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And for thyself, do thou go first of all

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>
to the swineherd who keeps thy swine, and withal has a kindly heart towards thee, and loves thy son and constant Penelope. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.407"/>Thou wilt find him abiding by the swine, and they are feeding by the rock of Corax and the spring Arethusa, eating acorns to their heart's content and

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.420"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:13.430-13.433"/>She withered the fair flesh on his supple limbs, and destroyed the flaxen hair from off his head, and about all his limbs she put the skin of an aged old man.

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.5-14.7"/>He found him sitting in the fore-hall of his house, where his court was built high in a place of wide outlook, a great and goodly court with an open space around it.

were penned fifty wallowing swine, females for breeding; but the boars slept without. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.16-14.17"/>These were far fewer in numbers, for on them the godlike wooers feasted, and lessened them, for the swineherd ever sent in the best of all the fatted hogs,

which numbered three hundred and sixty. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.20"/>By these ever slept four dogs, savage as wild beasts, which the swineherd had reared, a leader of men.

had gone, three of them, one here one there, with the droves of swine; and the fourth he had sent to the city to drive perforce a boar to the insolent wooers, that they might slay it and satisfy their souls with meat.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.26-14.28"/>Suddenly then the baying hounds caught sight of Odysseus,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.45-14.47"/>But come with me, let us go to the hut, old man, that when thou hast satisfied thy heart with food and wine, thou too mayest tell whence thou art, and all the woes thou hast endured.</q></p>

who has toiled much for him, and whose labour the god makes to prosper, even as this work of mine prospers, to which I give heed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.67"/>Therefore would my master have richly rewarded me, if he had grown old here at home: but he perished—as I would all the kindred of Helen had perished in utter ruin, since she loosened the knees of many warriors.

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.70-14.71"/>For he too went forth to win recompense for Agamemnon to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, famed for its horses, that he might fight with the Trojans.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.74-14.75"/>Choosing two from thence, he brought them in and slew them both,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.76-14.77"/>Then, when he had roasted all, he brought and set it before Odysseus, hot upon the spits, and sprinkled over it white barley meal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.77"/>Then in a bowl of ivy wood he mixed honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against Odysseus, and bade him to his food, and said:

<q>

twelve herds of kine has he on the mainland; as many flocks of sheep; as many droves of swine; as many packed herds of goats do herdsmen, both foreigners and of his own people, pasture.

greedily, in silence, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.111-14.113"/>But when he had dined, and satisfied his soul with food, then the swineherd filled the bowl from which he was himself wont to drink, and gave it him brim full of wine, and he took it, and was glad at heart; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.118"/>For Zeus, I ween, and the other immortal gods know

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
whether I have seen him, and could bring tidings; for I have wandered far.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.120"/>Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.121"/>Old man, no wanderer that came and brought tidings of him could persuade his wife and his dear son; nay, at random, when they have need of entertainment, do vagabonds

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
lie, and are not minded to speak the truth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.126-14.127"/>Whosoever in his wanderings comes to the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, goes to my mistress and tells a deceitful tale. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.128-14.130"/>And she, receiving him kindly, gives him entertainment, and questions him of all things, and the tears fall from her eyelids, while she weeps,

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>
as is the way of a woman, when her husband dies afar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.131"/>And readily wouldest thou too, old man, fashion a story, if one would give thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.132"/>But as for him, ere now dogs and swift birds are like to have torn the flesh from his bones, and his spirit has left him;

or in the sea fishes have eaten him, and his bones lie there on the shore, wrapped in deep sand. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.135-14.136"/>Thus has he perished yonder, and to his friends grief is appointed for days to come, to all, but most of all to me.

not though I come again to the house of my father and mother, where at the first I was born, and they reared me themselves.

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.145-14.146"/>His name, stranger, absent though he is, I speak with awe, for greatly did he love me and care for me at heart; but I call him my lord beloved, for all he is not here.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.470-14.471"/>The leaders were Odysseus and Menelaus, son of Atreus, and with them I was third in command; for so had they ordered it themselves. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.471"/>Now when we had come to the city and the steep wall, round about the town in the thick brushwood among the needs and swamp-land

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>
we lay, crouching beneath our arms, and night came on, foul, when the North Wind had fallen, and frosty, and snow came down on us from above, covering us like rime, bitter cold, and ice formed upon our shields. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.475-14.476"/>Now all the rest had cloaks and tunics, and slept in peace, with their shields covering their shoulders,

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
but I, when I set out, had left my cloak behind with my comrades in my folly, for I did not think that even so I should be cold, and had come with my shield alone and my bright kilt. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.480-14.482"/>But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, then I spoke to Odysseus, who was near me,

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>
nudging him with my elbow; and he straightway gave ear:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.485"/>Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, lo now, no longer shall I be among the living. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.486-14.488"/>Nay, the cold is killing me, for I have no cloak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.488"/>Some god beguiled me to wear my tunic only, and now there is no more escape.</q></p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
<p>So I spoke, and he then devised this plan in his heart, such a man was he both to plan and to fight; and speaking in a low voice he said to me: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.490-14.491"/>Be silent now, lest another of the Achaeans hear thee.</q></p></q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.492"/>With this he raised his head upon his elbow, and spoke, saying:

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.495"/>Hear me, friends; a dream from the gods came to me in my sleep. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.495"/>Lo, we have come very far from the ships, and I would that there were one to bear word to Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, in the hope that he might bid more men to come from the ships.</q></p>
<p>So he spoke, and Thoas, son of Andraemon, sprang up

<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>
quickly, and from him flung his purple cloak, and set out to run to the ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.501-14.502"/>Then in his garment I gladly lay, and golden-throned Dawn appeared. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.503"/>Would that I were young as then, and my strength as firm; then would one of the swineherds in the farmstead give me a cloak

<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>
both from kindness and from respect for a brave warrior. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.506"/>But as it is they scorn me, since I have foul raiment about me.</p></q></p>
    <p>To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.507"/>Old man, the tale thou hast told is a good one, nor hast thou thus far spoken aught amiss or unprofitably.

<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.510-14.512"/>Wherefore thou shalt lack neither clothing nor aught else that a sore-tried suppliant should receive, when he meets one—for this night at least; but in the morning thou shalt shake about thee those rags of thine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.512"/>For not many cloaks are here or changes of tunics to put on, but each man has one alone.

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.515-14.517"/>But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself give thee a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.518-14.519"/>So saying, he sprang up and placed a bed for Odysseus near the fire, and cast upon it skins of sheep and goats.

<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.520"/>There Odysseus lay down, and the swineherd threw over him a great thick cloak, which he kept at hand for a change of clothing whenever a terrible storm should arise.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.520-14.522"/>So there Odysseus slept, and beside him slept the young men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.523-14.524"/>But the swineherd

<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>
liked not a bed in that place, that he should lay him down away from the boars; so he made ready to go outside. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.526-14.527"/>And Odysseus was glad that he took such care of his master's substance while he was afar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:14.528-14.531"/>First Eumaeus flung his sharp sword over his strong shoulders, and then put about him a cloak, very thick, to keep off the wind;

<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>
and he picked up the fleece of a large, well-fatted goat, took a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and went forth to lie down to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock, in a place sheltered from the North Wind.</p>

lying in the fore-hall of the palace of glorious Menelaus.

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.20"/>For thou knowest what sort of a spirit there is in a woman's breast; she is fain to increase the house of the man who weds her, but of her former children and of the lord of her youth she takes no thought, when once he is dead, and asks no longer concerning them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.21-15.23"/>Nay, go, and thyself put all thy possessions in the charge of whatsoever one

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.27"/>And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.31"/>But do thou keep thy well-built ship far from the islands, and sail by night as well as by day, and that

he made haste to put about him his bright tunic, and to fling over his mighty shoulders a great cloak, and went forth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.64-15.65"/>Then Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, came up to Menelaus, and addressed him, saying:

send me back now at length to my dear native land, for now my heart is eager to return home.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.66"/>Then Menelaus, good at the war-cry, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.67"/>Telemachus, I verily shall not hold thee here a long time, when thou art eager to return. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.68-15.69"/>Nay, I should blame another,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
 who, as host, loves overmuch or hates overmuch; better is due measure in all things. 'Tis equal wrong if a man speed on a guest who is loath to go, and if he keep back one that is eager to be gone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.71"/>One should make welcome the present guest, and send forth him that would go.

in which were her richly-broidered robes, that she herself had wrought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.181"/>He spoke, and touched the two horses with the lash, and they sped swiftly toward the plain, coursing eagerly through the city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.182"/>So all day long they shook the yoke they bore about their necks.

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.185"/>And the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.186-15.187"/>And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.188"/>There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers. 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.189-15.191"/>As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
they yoked the horses, and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.192"/>Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward, and soon thereafter they reached the steep citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.193"/>Then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.195-15.196"/>Son of Nestor, wilt thou now make me a promise, and fulfil it, as I bid? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.196-15.197"/>Friends from of old we call ourselves by reason of our fathers' friendship, and we are moreover of the same age, and this journey shall yet more stablish us in oneness of heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.198"/>Lead me not past my ship, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me there,

lest that old man keep me in his house against my will, fain to show me kindness, whereas I must needs hasten home.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.201"/>So he spoke, and the son of Nestor took counsel with his heart, how he might duly give the promise and fulfil it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.202-15.203"/>And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course.

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.205-15.207"/>He turned his horses to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and took out, and set in the stern of the ship the beautiful gifts, the raiment and gold, which Menelaus gave him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.208"/>And he urged on Telemachus, and addressed him with winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.209-15.210"/>Make haste now to go on board, and bid all thy comrades to do likewise,

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
before I reach home and bring the old man word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.211"/>For well I know this in mind and heart, so masterful is his spirit he will not let thee go, but will himself come hither to bid thee to his house; and, I tell thee, he will not go back without thee; for very wroth will he be, despite of all.</q> 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.215-15.216"/>So saying, he drove his horses with beautiful mane back to the city of the Pylians, and speedily reached the palace. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.217"/>And Telemachus called to his men, and gave command to them, saying:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.423"/>Then he asked her who she was, and whence she came, and she straightway shewed him the high-roofed home of my father, and said:</p><p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.427-15.429"/>But Taphian pirates seized me, as I was coming from the fields, and brought me hither, and sold me to the house of yonder man, and he paid for me a goodly price.</q></p><p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.433"/>For of a truth they yet live, and are accounted rich.</q></p>
<p>Then the woman answered him, and said:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.435-15.436"/>This may well be, if you sailors will pledge yourselves by an oath, that you will bring me safely home.</q></p>
<p>So she spoke, and they all gave an oath thereto, as she bade them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.437"/>But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath, the woman again spoke among them, and made answer:</p><p>

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.440-15.442"/>Be silent now, and let no one of your company speak to me, if he meets me in the street or haply at the well, lest some one go to the palace and tell the old king, and he wax suspicious and bind me with grievous bonds, and devise death for you.

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.445"/>Nay, keep my words in mind, and speed the barter of your wares. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.446-15.447"/>But, when your ship is laden with goods, let a message come quickly to me at the palace; for I will also bring whatever gold comes under my hand.

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.457-15.458"/>And they remained there in our land a full year, and got by trade much substance in their hollow ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.459-15.460"/>But when their hollow ship was laden for their return, then they sent a messenger to bear tidings to the woman. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>There came a man, well versed in guile, to my father's house

with a necklace of gold, and with amber beads was it strung between.

but she took me by the hand, and led me forth from the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.466-15.467"/>Now in the fore-hall of the palace she found the cups and tables of the banqueters, who waited upon my father. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.468-15.470"/>They had gone forth to the council and the people's place of debate, but she quickly hid three goblets in her bosom,

and bore them away; and I followed in my heedlessness. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.470"/>Then the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.471"/>And we made haste and came to the goodly harbor, where was the swift ship of the Phoenicians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.472-15.473"/>Then they embarked,

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>
putting both of us on board as well, and sailed over the watery ways, and Zeus sent them a favorable wind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.475"/>For six days we sailed, night and day alike; but when Zeus, son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day, then Artemis, the archer, smote the woman, and she fell with a thud into the hold, as a sea bird plunges.

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.480-15.481"/>Her they cast forth to be a prey to seals and fishes, but I was left, my heart sore stricken.

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.491-15.492"/>Thus they spoke to one another, and then lay down to sleep, for no long time, but for a little;

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>
for soon came fair-throned Dawn. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.495"/>But the comrades of Telemachus, drawing near the shore, furled the sail, and took down the mast quickly, and rowed the ship to her anchorage with their oars. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.495-15.497"/>Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea,

<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>
and made ready their meal and mixed the flaming wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.501-15.502"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.503-15.504"/>Do you now row the black ship to the city, but I will visit the fields and the herdsmen,

<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>
and at evening will come to the city when I have looked over my lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.506-15.507"/>Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.508"/>Whither shall I go, dear child? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.509"/>To whose house shall I come

of those who rule in rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.511"/>Or shall I go straight to thy mother's house and thine?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.512"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.513-15.514"/>Were things otherwise, I should bid thee go even to our house, for there is in no wise lack of entertainment for strangers, but

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>
it would be worse for thyself, since I shall be away, and my mother will not see thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.516-15.517"/>For she does not often appear before the wooers in the house, but apart from them weaves at her loom in an upper chamber. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.518-15.520"/>But I will tell thee of another man to whom thou mayest go, Eurymachus, glorious son of wise Polybus,

whom now the men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> look upon as on a god. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.521-15.522"/>For he is by far the best man, and is most eager to marry my mother and to have the honor of Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.523-15.524"/>Nevertheless Olympian Zeus, who dwells in the sky, knows this, whether or not before marriage he will fulfil for them the evil day.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.525-15.526"/>Even as he spoke a bird flew forth upon the right, a hawk, the swift messenger of Apollo. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.526-15.528"/>In his talons he held a dove, and was plucking her and shedding the feathers down on the ground midway between the ship and Telemachus himself. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.529-15.530"/>Then Theoclymenus called him apart from his companions,

<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>
and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.531-15.532"/>Telemachus, surely not without a god's warrant has this bird flown forth upon our right, for I knew, as I looked upon him, that he was a bird of omen.

<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.535"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him again: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.536"/>Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.537-15.538"/>Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one that met thee would call thee blessed.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.539"/>Therewith he spoke to Peiraeus, his trusty comrade:

<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>
 <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.540-15.541"/>Peiraeus, son of Clytius, it is thou that in other matters art wont to hearken to me above all my comrades, who went with me to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>; so now do thou, I pray thee, take this stranger and give him kindly welcome in thy house, and show him honor until I come.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.545-15.546"/>Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.547-15.548"/>Telemachus, though thou shouldest stay here long, I will entertain him, and he shall have no lack of what is due to strangers.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.549"/>So saying, he went on board the ship, and bade his comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So they went on board straightway, and sat down upon the benches.

<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.550-15.552"/>But Telemachus bound beneath his feet his fair sandals, and took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.552"/>Then the men loosed the stern cables, and thrusting off, sailed to the city, as Telemachus bade, the dear son of divine Odysseus.

<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:15.555-15.557"/>But his feet bore him swiftly on, as he strode forward, until he reached the farmstead where were his countless swine, among whom slept the worthy swineherd with a heart loyal to his masters.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Meanwhile the two in the hut, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, had kindled a fire, and were making ready their breakfast at dawn, and had sent forth the herdsmen with the droves of swine; but around Telemachus the baying hounds fawned,

and barked not as he drew near. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.5-16.6"/>And goodly Odysseus noted the fawning of the hounds, and the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears; and straightway he spoke to Eumaeus winged words:

but fawn about him, and I hear the sound of footsteps.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.10"/>Not yet was the word fully uttered, when his own dear son stood in the doorway. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.11-16.12"/>In amazement up sprang the swineherd, and from his hands the vessels fell with which he was busied as he mixed the flaming wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.12-16.14"/>And he went to meet his lord,

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes and his two hands, and a big tear fell from him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.16"/>And as a loving father greets his own dear son, who comes in the tenth year from a distant land—his only son and well-beloved, for whose sake he has borne much sorrow—

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>
even so did the goodly swineherd then clasp in his arms godlike Telemachus, and kiss him all over as one escaped from death; and with wailing he addressed him with winged words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.22"/>Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes.

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.25-16.26"/>But come, enter in, dear child, that I may delight my heart with looking at thee here in my house, who art newly come from other lands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.27-16.28"/>For thou dost not often visit the farm and the herdsmen, but abidest in the town; so, I ween, has it seemed good to thy heart, to look upon the destructive throng of the wooers.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.30"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.31"/>So shall it be, father. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.31-16.35"/>It is for thy sake that I am come hither, to see thee with my eyes, and to hear thee tell whether my mother still abides in the halls, or whether by now some other man has wedded her, and the couch of Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
lies haply in want of bedding, covered with foul spider-webs.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.36"/>Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.37-16.38"/>Aye, verily, she abides with steadfast heart in thy halls, and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and the days wane as she weeps.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.40"/>So saying, he took from him the spear of bronze, and Telemachus went in and passed over the stone threshold. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.41"/>As he drew near, his father, Odysseus, rose from his seat and gave him place, but Telemachus on his part checked him, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.46"/>Then the swineherd set before them platters

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>
of roast meats, which they had left at their meal the day before, and quickly heaped up bread in baskets, and mixed in a bowl of ivy wood honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.55-16.56"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Telemachus spoke to the goodly swineherd, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.60"/>To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.65-16.66"/>But now he has run away from a ship of the Thesprotians and come to my farmstead, and I shall put him in thy hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.67"/>Do what thou wilt. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.67"/>He declares himself thy suppliant.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.68"/>Then again wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.69"/>Eumaeus, verily this word which thou hast uttered stings me to the heart.

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.70"/>For how am I to welcome this stranger in my house? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.71-16.72"/>I am myself but young, nor have I yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.73-16.77"/>And as for my mother, the heart in her breast wavers this way and that, whether to abide here with me and keep the house,

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
respecting the bed of her husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans that woo her in the halls, and offers the most gifts of wooing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.78-16.81"/>But verily, as regards this stranger, now that he has come to thy house, I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,

and will give him a two-edged sword, and sandals for his feet, and send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.82"/>Or, if thou wilt, do thou keep him here at the farmstead, and care for him, and raiment will I send hither and all his food to eat, that he be not the ruin of thee and of thy men.

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.85-16.86"/>But thither will I not suffer him to go, to join the company of the wooers, for they are over-full of wanton insolence, lest they mock him, and dread grief come upon me.

and wine drawn to waste, and men devouring my bread all heedlessly, without limit, with no end to the business.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.112"/>And wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.113"/>Then verily, stranger, I will frankly tell thee all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.114-16.116"/>Neither do the people at large bear me any grudge or hatred,

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
nor have I cause to blame brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts, even if a great strife arise. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.117"/>For in this wise has the son of Cronos made our house to run in but a single line. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.118-16.119"/>As his only son did Arceisius beget Laertes, as his only son again did his father beget Odysseus, and Odysseus

begot me as his only son, and left me in his halls, and had no joy of me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.121"/>Therefore it is that foes past counting are now in the house; for all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>,

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.126-16.127"/>And she neither refuses the hateful marriage, nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance, and will ere long bring me, too, to ruin. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.127-16.128"/>Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods.

was still wont to oversee the fields, and would eat and drink with the slaves in the house, as the heart in his breast bade him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.146"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>'Tis the sadder; but none the less we will let him be, despite our sorrow; for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing, we should choose first of all the day of my father's return.

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.150-16.151"/>No, do thou come back, when thou hast given thy message, and wander not over the fields in search of Laertes; but did my mother with all speed send forth her handmaid, the housewife, secretly, for she might bear word to the old man.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.151-16.153"/>With this he roused the swineherd, and he took his sandals in his hands

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.155-16.157"/>Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead, but she drew near in the likeness of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork.

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
but Telemachus did not see her before him, or notice her; for in no wise do the gods appear in manifest presence to all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.160-16.163"/>But Odysseus saw her, and the hounds, and they barked not, but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.164"/>The she made a sign with her brows, and goodly Odysseus perceived it,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
and went forth from the hall, past the great wall of the court, and stood before her, and Athena spoke to him, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.166"/>Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.172"/>With this, Athena touched him with her golden wand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.177"/>Then, when she had wrought thus, she departed, but Odysseus went into the hut. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.177-16.178"/>And his dear son marvelled, and, seized with fear, turned his eyes aside, lest it should be a god.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.181-16.182"/>And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.185"/>Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.186"/>Be sure I am no god; why dost thou liken me to the immortals? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.187"/>Nay, I am thy father, for whose sake thou dost with groaning endure many griefs, and submittest to the violence of men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.190-16.191"/>So saying, he kissed his son, and from his cheeks let fall a tear to earth, but before he ever steadfastly held them back. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.191"/>Howbeit Telemachus—for he did not yet believe that it was his father—again answered, and spoke to him, saying:

beguiles me, that I may weep and groan yet more. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.196-16.198"/>For nowise could a mortal man contrive this by his own wit, unless a god were himself to come to him, and easily by his will make him young or old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.199"/>For verily but now thou wast an old man and meanly clad,

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
whereas now thou art like the gods, who hold broad heaven.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.200"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.201"/>Telemachus, it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house, or to be amazed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.202-16.203"/>For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither;

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
but I here, I, even such as thou seest me, after sufferings and many wanderings, am come in the twentieth year to my native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.207-16.210"/>But this, thou must know, is the work of Athena, driver of the spoil, who makes me such as she will—for she has the power—now like a beggar, and now again

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
like a young man, and one wearing fair raiment about his body. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.211-16.212"/>Easy it is for the gods, who hold broad heaven, both to glorify a mortal man and to abase him.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.213-16.215"/>So saying, he sat down, and Telemachus, flinging his arms about his noble father, wept and shed tears,

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
and in the hearts of both arose a longing for lamentation. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.216-16.218"/>And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds, sea-eagles, or vultures with crooked talons, whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged; even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows.

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.220-16.221"/>And now would the light of the sun have gone down upon their weeping, had not Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.229-16.231"/>And they brought me as I slept in a swift ship over the sea,

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
and set me down in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and gave me glorious gifts, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.235-16.236"/>Come now, count me the wooers, and tell their tale, that I may know how many they are and what manner of men, and that I may ponder in my noble heart and decide whether we two shall be able to maintain our cause against them alone without others, or whether we shall also seek out others.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.240"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.247-16.248"/>From Dulichium there are two and fifty chosen youths, and six serving men attend them; from Same came four and twenty men;

from <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName> there are twenty youths of the Achaeans; and from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself twelve men, all of them the noblest, and with them is Medon, the herald, and the divine minstrel, and two squires skilled in carving meats.

bitter, I fear, and with bane will be thy coming to avenge violence. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.256-16.257"/>Nay, do thou consider, if thou canst bethink thee of any helper—one that would aid us two with a ready heart.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.258"/>Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him:<q>

and consider whether for us two Athena, with father Zeus, will be enough, or whether I shall bethink me of some other helper.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.260-16.261"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

let the heart in thy breast endure while I am evil entreated, even if they drag me by the feet through the house to the door, or hurl at me and smite me; still do thou endure to behold it.

will they hearken to thee, for verily their day of doom is at hand. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart.

and lay them away one and all in the secret place of the lofty store-room. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.286-16.287"/>And as for the wooers, when they miss the arms and question thee, do thou beguile them with gentle words, saying:</p>

but are all befouled so far as the breath of the fire has reached them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.291-16.294"/>And furthermore this greater fear has the son of Cronos put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing.

<p>But for us two alone do thou leave behind two swords and two spears, and two ox-hide shields for us to grasp, that we may rush upon them and seize them; while as for the wooers, Pallas Athena and Zeus, the counsellor, will beguile them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.361-16.362"/>Themselves meanwhile went all together to the place of assembly, and none other would they suffer to sit with them, either of the young men or the old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.363"/>Then among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.364"/>Lo, now, see how the gods have delivered this man from destruction.

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.365-16.366"/>Day by day watchmen sat upon the windy heights, watch ever following watch, and at set of sun we never spent a night upon the shore, but sailing over the deep in our swift ship we waited for the bright Dawn, lying in wait for Telemachus, that we might take him and slay

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
the man himself; howbeit meanwhile some god has brought him home. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.370-16.372"/>But, on our part, let us here devise for him a woeful death, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape from out our hands, for I deem that while he lives this work of ours will not prosper. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.372-16.373"/>For he is himself shrewd in counsel and in wisdom,

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
and the people nowise show us favour any more. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.376-16.379"/>Nay, come, before he gathers the Achaeans to the place of assembly—for methinks he will in no wise be slow to act, but will be full of wrath, and rising up will declare among them all how that we contrived against him utter destruction, but did not catch him;

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
and they will not praise us when they hear of our evil deeds. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.380"/>Beware, then, lest they work us some harm and drive us out from our country, and we come to the land of strangers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.381-16.382"/>Nay, let us act first, and seize him in the field far from the city, or on the road; and his substance let us ourselves keep, and his wealth,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
dividing them fairly among us; though the house we would give to his mother to possess, and to him who weds her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.387-16.391"/>Howbeit if this plan does not please you, but you choose rather that he should live and keep all the wealth of his fathers, let us not continue to devour his store of pleasant things

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
as we gather together here, but let each man from his own hall woo her with his gifts and seek to win her; and she then would wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.391-16.392"/>So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.393"/>Then Amphinomus addressed their assembly, and spoke among them.

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.398"/>He was the glorious son of the prince Nisus, son of Aretias, and he led the wooers who came from Dulichium, rich in wheat and in grass, and above all the others he pleased Penelope with his words, for he had an understanding heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.399"/>He it was who with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.400-16.401"/>Friends, I surely would not choose to kill Telemachus; a dread thing is it to slay one of royal stock. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.401-16.402"/>Nay, let us first seek to learn the will of the gods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.402"/>If the oracles of great Zeus approve, I will myself slay him, and bid all the others do so;

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>
but if the gods turn us from the act, I bid you desist.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.405"/>Thus spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.406"/>So they arose straightway and went to the house of Odysseus, and entering in, sat down on the polished seats.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.407-16.408"/>Then the wise Penelope took other counsel,

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
to show herself to the wooers, overweening in their insolence. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.411"/>For she had learned of the threatened death of her son in her halls, for the herald Medon told her, who had heard their counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.412"/>So she went her way toward the hall with her handmaids. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.413"/>But when the fair lady reached the wooers,

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil; and she rebuked Antinous, and spoke, and addressed him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.418-16.420"/>Antinous, full of insolence, deviser of evil! and yet it is thou, men say, that dost excel among all of thy years in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
in counsel and in speech. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.420"/>But thou, it seems, art not such a man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.421-16.423"/>Madman! why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus, and carest not for suppliants, for whom Zeus is witness. 'Tis an impious thing to plot evil one against another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.423"/>Dost thou not know of the time when thy father came to this house a fugitive

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
in terror of the people? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.425-16.427"/>For of a truth they were greatly wroth with him because he had joined Taphian pirates and harried the Thesprotians, who were in league with us. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.427"/>Him, then, they were minded to slay, and take from him his life by violence, and utterly to devour his great and pleasant livelihood;

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>
but Odysseus held them back, and stayed them despite their eagerness. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.430"/>His house it is that thou consumest now without atonement, and wooest his wife, and seekest to slay his son, and on me thou bringest great distress. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.431-16.432"/>Nay, forbear, I charge thee, and bid the rest forbear.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.433"/>Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her:

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.435-16.436"/>Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, be of good cheer, and let not things distress thy heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.436"/>That man lives not, nor shall live, nor shall ever be born, who shall lay hands upon thy son Telemachus while I live and behold the light upon the earth.

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.440"/>For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.441-16.444"/>Quickly shall that man's black blood flow forth about my spear; for of a truth me, too, did Odysseus the sacker of cities often set upon his knees, and put roast meat in my hands, and hold to my lips red wine.

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.445-16.447"/>Therefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid him have no fear of death, at least from the wooers; but from the gods can no man avoid it.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.447"/>Thus he spoke to cheer her, but against that son he was himself plotting death. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.448"/>So she went up to her bright upper chamber

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>
and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.452-16.453"/>But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son, and they were busily making ready their supper, and had slain a boar of a year old. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.453-16.454"/>Then Athena

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>
came close to Odysseus, son of Laertes, and smote him with her wand, and again made him an old man; and mean raiment she put about his body, lest the swineherd might look upon him and know him, and might go to bear tidings to constant Penelope, and not hold the secret fast in his heart.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.460"/>Now Telemachus spoke first to the swineherd, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.461"/>Thou hast come, goodly Eumaeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.461"/>What news is there in the city? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.462-16.463"/>Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.464"/>To him, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:

<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.465-16.466"/>I was not minded to go about the city, asking and enquiring of this; my heart bade me with all speed to come back hither when I had given my message. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.466-16.467"/>But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions, a herald, who was the first to tell the news to thy mother.

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.470"/>And this further thing I know, for I saw it with my eyes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.470"/>I was now above the city, as I went on my way, where the hill of Hermes is, when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor, and there were many men in her, and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears.

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.475"/>And I thought it was they, but I have no knowledge.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.476-16.477"/>So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father, but shunned the swineherd's eye.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.478-16.479"/>And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they fell to feasting, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast.

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:16.480-16.481"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, they bethought them of rest, and took the gift of sleep.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, bound beneath his feet his fair sandals and took his mighty spear, that fitted his grasp,

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
hasting to the city; and he spoke to his swineherd, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.6-17.7"/>Father, I verily am going to the city, that my mother may see me, for, methinks, she will not cease from woeful wailing and tearful lamentation until she sees my very self. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.7-17.9"/>But to thee I give this charge.

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.10-17.11"/>Lead this wretched stranger to the city, that there he may beg his food, and whoso will shall give him a loaf and a cup of water. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.11-17.12"/>For my part, I can in no wise burden myself with all men, seeing that I have grief at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.12-17.13"/>But if the stranger is sore angered at this,

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
it will be the worse for him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.15"/>I verily love to speak the truth.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.16"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.17"/>Friend, be sure I am not myself fain to be left here. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.18-17.19"/>For a beggar it is better to beg his food in the town than in the fields, and whoso will shall give it me.

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.20-17.21"/>For I am no more of an age to remain at the farmstead, so as to obey in all things the command of an overseer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.22"/>Nay, go thy way; this man that thou biddest will lead me as soon as I have warmed myself at the fire, and the sun has grown hot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.22-17.23"/>For miserably poor are these garments which I wear, and I fear lest

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
the morning frost may overcome me; and ye say it is far to the city.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.25"/>So he spoke, and Telemachus passed out through the farmstead with rapid strides, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.26-17.27"/>But when he came to the stately house he set his spear in place, leaning it against a tall pillar,

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>
and himself went in and crossed the threshold of stone.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.31-17.33"/>Him the nurse Eurycleia was far the first to see, as she was spreading fleeces on the richly-wrought chairs. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.33-17.35"/>With a burst of tears she came straight toward him, and round about them gathered the other maids of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.36-17.40"/>Then forth from her chamber came wise Penelope, like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and bursting into tears she flung her arms about her dear son, and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes;

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
and with wailing she spoke to him winged words:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.45"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her:<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.48-17.51"/>Nay, bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then, going to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids,

vow to all the gods that thou wilt offer hecatombs that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus may some day bring deeds of requital to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
and I bade Peiraeus take him home and give him kindly welcome, and show him honor until I should come.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.57"/>So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.58-17.60"/>Then she bathed and took clean raiment for her body, and vowed to all the gods that she would offer hecatombs

that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus would some day bring deeds of requital to pass.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.61-17.62"/>But Telemachus thereafter went forth through the hall with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.62"/>And wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came.

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.65-17.66"/>Round about him the proud wooers thronged, speaking him fair, but pondering evil in the deep of their hearts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.67-17.70"/>Howbeit he avoided the great throng of these men, but where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, and Halitherses, who were friends of his father's house of old,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
there he went and sat down, and they questioned him of each thing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.70"/>Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, drew near, leading the stranger through the city to the place of assembly; and Telemachus did not long turn away from his guest, but went up to him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.71-17.72"/>Then Peiraeus was the first to speak, saying:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.77"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.78"/>Peiraeus, we know not how these things will be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.79-17.81"/>If the proud wooers

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.85-17.87"/>Now when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats, and went into the polished baths and bathed.

they came forth from the baths and sat down upon the chairs.

the wise Penelope spoke first among them:

and he received me in his lofty house and gave me kindly welcome, as a father might his own son who after a long time had newly come from a far: even so kindly he tended me with his glorious sons. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.110-17.112"/>Yet of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,

whether living or dead, he said he had heard naught from any man on earth.

and upon the two lets loose a cruel doom, so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.132-17.136"/>I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength, as when once in fair-stablished <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced, even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.137"/>But in this matter of which thou dost ask and entreat me, verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive thee;

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me, not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.142-17.144"/>He said that he had seen Odysseus in an island in grievous distress, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.144"/>And he cannot come to his own native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars, and no comrades,

to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea.</q></p>
<p>So spoke Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.145-17.147"/>Now when I had made an end of all this I set out for home, and the immortals gave me a fair wind and brought me quickly to my dear native land.</p></q></p><p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.150"/>So he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.151"/>Then among them spoke also the godlike Theoclymenus, saying:</p><p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.155-17.159"/>Be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily Odysseus is even now in his native land, resting or moving, learning of these evil deeds, and he is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.160-17.161"/>So plain a bird of omen did I mark as I sat on the benched ship, and I declared it to Telemachus.</q></p><p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.166-17.169"/>Thus they spoke to one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And the wooers meanwhile in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart.

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.170-17.172"/>But when it was the hour for dinner, and the flocks came in from all sides from the fields, and the men led them who were wont to lead, then Medon, who of all the heralds was most to their liking and was ever present at their feasts, spoke to them, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.172-17.173"/>Youths, now that you have all made glad your hearts with sport,

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
come to the house that we may make ready a feast; for it is no bad thing to take one's dinner in season.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.176"/>So he spoke, and they rose up and went, and hearkened to his word. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.177"/>And when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted and swine, and a heifer of the herd, and so made ready the meal. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.182-17.183"/>But Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were making haste to go from the field to the city; and the swineherd, a leader of men, spoke first, and said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.185-17.187"/>Stranger, since thou art eager to go the city today, as my master bade—though for myself I would rather have thee left here to keep the farmstead; but I reverence and fear him, lest hereafter he chide me, and hard are the rebukes of masters—

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
come now, let us go. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.190-17.191"/>The day is far spent, and soon thou wilt find it colder toward evening.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.192"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.193"/>I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.193"/>Come, let us go, and be thou my guide all the way.

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.195-17.196"/>But give me a staff to lean upon, if thou hast one cut anywhere, for verily ye said that the way was treacherous.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.197-17.198"/>He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord, and Eumaeus gave him a staff to his liking.

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.200-17.201"/>So they two set forth, and the dogs and the herdsmen stayed behind to guard the farmstead; but the swineherd led his master to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff; and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.201-17.203"/>But when, as they went along the rugged path,

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
they were near the city, and had come to a well-wrought, fair-flowing fountain, wherefrom the townsfolk drew water—this Ithacus had made, and Neritus, and Polyctor, and around was a grove of poplars, that grow by the waters, circling it on all sides, and down the cold water flowed

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
from the rock above, and on the top was built an altar to the nymphs where all passers-by made offerings—there Melantheus, son of Dolius, met them as he was driving his she-goats, the best that were in all the herds, to make a feast for the wooers; and two herdsmen followed with him.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.215-17.216"/>As he saw them, he spoke and addressed them, and reviled them in terrible and unseemly words, and stirred the heart of Odysseus:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.217-17.218"/>As ever, the god is bringing like and like together.

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
this nuisance of a beggar to mar our feasts? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.221-17.222"/>He is a man to stand and rub his shoulders on many doorposts, begging for scraps, not for swords or cauldrons.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.223-17.225"/>If thou wouldest give me this fellow to keep my farmstead, to sweep out the pens and to carry young shoots to the kids,

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
then by drinking whey he might get himself a sturdy thigh. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.226-17.228"/>But since he has learned only deeds of evil, he will not care to busy himself with work, but is minded rather to go skulking through the land, that by begging he may feed his insatiate belly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.229"/>But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.230-17.232"/>If he comes to the palace of divine Odysseus, many a footstool, hurled about his head by the hands of those that are men, shall be broken on his ribs<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> as he is pelted through the house.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.233-17.234"/>So he spoke, and as he passed he kicked Odysseus on the hip in his folly, yet he did not drive him from the path,

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
but he stood steadfast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.235-17.237"/>And Odysseus pondered whether he should leap upon him and take his life with his staff, or seize him round about,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and lift him up, and dash his head upon the ground. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.238"/>Yet he endured, and stayed him from his purpose. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.238-17.239"/>And the swineherd looked the man in the face, and rebuked him, and lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.240-17.243"/>Nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned upon your altars pieces of the thighs of lambs or kids, wrapped in rich fat, fulfil for me this prayer; grant that he, my master, may come back, and that some god may guide him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.244-17.246"/>Then would he scatter all the proud airs

which now thou puttest on in thy insolence,ever roaming about the city, while evil herdsmen destroy the flock.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.254-17.255"/>So saying, he left them there, as they walked slowly on,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
but himself strode forward and right swiftly came to the palace of the king. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.256-17.257"/>Straightway he entered in and sat down among the wooers over against Eurymachus, for he loved him best of all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.257"/>Then by him those that served set a portion of meat, and the grave housewife brought and set before him bread,

for him to eat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.260-17.262"/>And Odysseus and the goodly swineherd halted as they drew nigh, and about them rang the sound of the hollow lyre, for Phemius was striking the chords to sing before the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.262-17.263"/>Then Odysseus clasped the swineherd by the hand, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.263"/>Eumaeus, surely this is the beautiful house of Odysseus.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.266-17.268"/>Easily might it be known, though seen among many. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.268"/>There is building upon building, and the court is built with wall and coping, and the double gates are well-fenced; no man may scorn it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.269-17.271"/>And I mark that in the house itself many

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
men are feasting: for the savour of meat arises from it, and therewith resounds the voice of the lyre, which the gods have made the companion of the feast.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.272"/>To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.273"/>Easily hast thou marked it, for in all things thou art ready of wit. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.274"/>But come, let us take thought how these things shall be.

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.275-17.276"/>Either do thou go first into the stately palace, and enter the company of the wooers, and I will remain behind here, or, if thou wilt, remain thou here and I will go before thee.

amid the waves and in war; let this too be added to what has gone before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.290"/>Thus they spoke to one another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.294-17.295"/>In days past the young men were wont to take the hound to hunt

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
the wild goats, and deer, and hares; but now he lay neglected, his master gone, in the deep dung of mules and cattle, which lay in heaps before the doors, till the slaves of Odysseus should take it away to dung his wide lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.300"/>There lay the hound <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, full of vermin; yet even now, when he marked Odysseus standing near, he wagged his tail and dropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had no longer strength to move. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.301-17.304"/>Then Odysseus looked aside and wiped away a tear,

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>
easily hiding from Eumaeus what he did; and straightway he questioned him, and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.306"/>Eumaeus, verily it is strange that this hound lies here in the dung. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.307-17.310"/>He is fine of form, but I do not clearly know whether he has speed of foot to match this beauty or whether he is merely as table-dogs

are, which their masters keep for show.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.310"/>To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.311"/>Aye, verily this is the hound of a man that has died in a far land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.312"/>If he were but in form and in action such as he was when Odysseus left him and went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>
thou wouldest soon be amazed at seeing his speed and his strength. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.316-17.317"/>No creature that he started in the depths of the thick wood could escape him, and in tracking too he was keen of scent. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.317"/>But now he is in evil plight, and his master has perished far from his native land, and the heedless women give him no care.

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.320-17.321"/>Slaves, when their masters lose their power, are no longer minded thereafter to do honest service: for Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, takes away half his worth from a man, when the day of slavery comes upon him.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.322-17.323"/>So saying, he entered the stately house

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
and went straight to the hall to join the company of the lordly wooers.

with a nod he called him and to his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.333-17.334"/>This he took and placed at the table of Telemachus, over against him, and there sat down himself. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.334-17.335"/>And a herald

leaning against a post of cypress wood, which of old a carpenter had skilfully planed, and made straight to the line. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.342-17.344"/>Then Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and, taking a whole loaf from out the beautiful basket, and all the meat his hands could hold in their grasp, spoke to him saying:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.345-17.346"/>Take, and give this mess to yon stranger, and bid him go about himself and beg of the wooers one and all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.348-17.349"/>So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he had heard this saying, and coming up to Odysseus spoke to him winged words:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.350-17.351"/>Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these, and bids thee go about and beg of the wooers one and all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.352"/>Shame, he says, is no good thing in a beggar man.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.353"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said, <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.354-17.355"/>King Zeus, grant, I pray thee, that Telemachus may be blest among men,

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
and may have all that his heart desires.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.356-17.358"/>He spoke, and took the mess in both his hands and set it down there before his feet on his miserable wallet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.359"/>Then he ate so long as the minstrel sang in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But when he had dined and the divine minstrel was ceasing to sing,

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>
the wooers broke into uproar throughout the halls; but Athena drew close to the side of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and roused him to go among the wooers and gather bits of bread, and learn which of them were righteous and which lawless. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.360"/>Yet even so she was not minded to save one of them from ruin.

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.365-17.366"/>So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.367-17.368"/>And they pitied him and gave, and marvelled at him, asking one another who he was and whence he came.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.369"/>Then among them spoke Melanthius, the goatherd:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.380"/>To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.381"/>Antinous, no fair words are these thou speakest, noble though thou art. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.382-17.385"/>Who pray, of himself ever seeks out and bids a stranger from abroad, unless it be one of those that are masters of some public craft, a prophet, or a healer of ills, or a builder,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
aye, or a divine minstrel, who gives delight with his song? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.386"/>For these men are bidden all over the boundless earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.387"/>Yet a beggar would no man bid to be burden to himself. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.388-17.389"/>But thou art ever harsh above all the wooers to the slaves of Odysseus, and most of all to me; yet I

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
care not, so long as my lady, the constant Penelope, lives in the hall, and godlike Telemachus.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.392"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.393"/>Be silent: do not, I bid thee, answer yonder man with many words, for Antinous is wont ever in evil wise to provoke to anger

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
with harsh words, aye, and urges on the others too.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.396"/>With this he spoke winged words to Antinous: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.397-17.399"/>Antinous, truly thou carest well for me, as a father for his son, seeing that thou biddest me drive yonder stranger from the hall with a word of compulsion. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.399"/>May the god never bring such a thing to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.400"/>Nay, take and give him somewhat: I begrudge it not, but rather myself bid thee give. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.400"/>In this matter regard not my mother, no, nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.400"/>But verily far other is the thought in thy breast; for thou art far more fain thyself to eat than to give to another.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.405"/>Then Antinous answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.406"/>Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said! If all the wooers would but hand him as much as I, for full three months' space this house would keep him at a distance.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.407-17.408"/>So he spoke, and seized the footstool

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
on which he was wont to rest his shining feet as he feasted, and shewed it from beneath the table, where it lay. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.411-17.412"/>But all the rest gave gifts, and filled the wallet with bread and bits of meat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.412-17.413"/>And now Odysseus was like to have gone back again to the threshold, and to have made trial of the Achaeans without cost,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> but he paused by Antinous, and spoke to him, saying: 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.415"/>Friend, give me some gift; thou seemest not in my eyes to be the basest of the Achaeans, but rather the noblest, for thou art like a king. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.415-17.416"/>Therefore it is meet that thou shouldest give even a better portion of bread than the rest; so would I make thy fame known all over the boundless earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.417-17.418"/>For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men,

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.422-17.423"/>Slaves too I had past counting, and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.</q></p>

                        <p><q><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.424-17.426"/>But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught—so, I ween, was his good pleasure—

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
who sent me forth with roaming pirates to go to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, a far voyage, that I might meet my ruin; and in the river <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.427"/>I moored my curved ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.428-17.430"/>Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships and to guard the ships,

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>
and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.431-17.434"/>But my comrades, yielding to wantonness and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city.

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.435-17.436"/>Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen and chariots and the flashing of bronze. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.436-17.437"/>And Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had courage to take his stand and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side.

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.440-17.441"/>So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.442-17.443"/>But they gave me to a friend who met them to take to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, even to Dmetor, son of Iasus, who ruled mightily over <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>; and from thence am I now come hither, sore distressed.</p></q></p><p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.445"/>Then Antinous answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.446"/>What god has brought this bane hither to trouble our feast? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.447-17.448"/>Stand off yonder in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come presently to a bitter <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and a bitter <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, seeing that thou art a bold and shameless beggar.

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.450"/>Thou comest up to every man in turn, and they give recklessly; for there is no restraint or scruple in giving freely of another's goods, since each man has plenty beside him.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.450-17.452"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles drew back, and said to him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.453"/>Lo, now, it seems that thou at least hast not wits to match thy beauty.

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.455-17.457"/>Thou wouldest not out of thine own substance give even a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now, when sitting at another's table, hadst not the heart to take of the bread and give me aught. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.457"/>Yet here lies plenty at thy hand.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.458-17.459"/>So he spoke, and Antinous waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.460-17.461"/>Now verily, methinks, thou shalt no more go forth from the hall in seemly fashion, since thou dost even utter words of reviling.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:17.462-17.504">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.462-17.463"/>So saying, he seized the footstool and flung it, and struck Odysseus on the base of the right shoulder, where it joins the back. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.463-17.465"/>But he stood firm as a rock, nor did the missile of Antinous make him reel;

<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>
but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.466-17.467"/>Then back to the threshold he went and sat down, and down he laid his well-filled wallet; and he spoke among the wooers: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.468-17.469"/>Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me.

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.470-17.472"/>Verily there is no pain of heart nor any grief when a man is smitten while fighting for his own possessions, whether for his cattle or for his white sheep; but Antinous has smitten me for my wretched belly's sake, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men.

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.475-17.476"/>Ah, if for beggars there are gods and avengers, may the doom of death come upon Antinous before his marriage.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.477"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.478-17.480"/>Sit still, and eat, stranger, or go elsewhere; lest the young men drag thee

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
by hand or foot through the house for words like these, and strip off all thy skin.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.481"/>So he spoke, but they all were filled with exceeding indignation, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.482"/>Antinous, thou didst not well to strike the wretched wanderer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.483-17.484"/>Doomed man that thou art, what if haply he be some god come down from heaven!

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.485-17.487"/>Aye, and the gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.488"/>So spoke the wooers, but Antinous paid no heed to their words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.489-17.491"/>And Telemachus nursed in his heart great grief

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
for the smiting, though he let no tear fall from his eyelids to the ground; but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.492-17.493"/>Howbeit when wise Penelope heard of the man's being smitten in the hall, she spoke among her handmaids, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.494"/>Even so may thine own self be smitten by the famed archer Apollo.</q> 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.495"/>And again the housewife Eurynome said to her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.496"/>Would that fulfillment might be granted to our prayers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.497"/>So should not one of these men come to the fair-throned Dawn.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.498"/>And wise Penelope answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.499"/>Nurse, enemies are they all, for they devise evil.

<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.500"/>But Antinous more than all is like black fate. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.501-17.502"/>Some wretched stranger roams through the house, begging alms of the men, for want compels him, and all the others filled his wallet and gave him gifts, but Antinous flung a footstool and smote him at the base of the right shoulder.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:17.505-17.559">

<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.505-17.506"/>So she spoke among her handmaids, sitting in her chamber, while goodly Odysseus was at meat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.506"/>Then she called to her the goodly swineherd, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.507"/>Go, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I may give him greeting, and ask him

<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>
if haply he has heard of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, or has seen him with his eyes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.511"/>He seems like one that has wandered far.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.512-17.513"/>To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.514"/>I would, O queen, that the Achaeans would keep silence, for he speaks such words as would charm thy very soul.

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.515-17.516"/>Three nights I had him by me, and three days I kept him in my hut, for to me first he came when he fled by stealth from a ship, but he had not yet ended the tale of his sufferings. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.516"/>Even as when a man gazes upon a minstrel who sings to mortals songs of longing that the gods have taught him,

<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>
and their desire to hear him has no end, whensoever he sings, even so he charmed me as he sat in my hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.521"/>He says that he is an ancestral friend of Odysseus, and that he dwells in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, where is the race of Minos. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.522-17.523"/>From thence has he now come on this journey hither, ever suffering woes

<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>
as he wanders on and on. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.525-17.527"/>And he insists that he has heard tidings of Odysseus, near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians and yet alive; and he is bringing many treasures to his home.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.527"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.528"/>Go, call him hither, that he may himself tell me to my face.

<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.530"/>But as for these men, let them make sport as they sit in the doorway or here in the house, since their hearts are merry. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.531"/>For their own possessions lie untouched in their homes, bread and sweet wine, and on these do their servants feed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.532-17.533"/>But themselves throng our house day after day,

<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>
slaying our oxen, and sheep, and fat goats, and keep revel and drink the flaming wine recklessly, and havoc is made of all this wealth, for there is no man here such as Odysseus was to keep ruin from the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.537"/>But if Odysseus should come and return to his native land,

<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>
straightway would he with his son take vengeance on these men for their violent deeds.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.541-17.542"/>So she spoke, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and all the room round about echoed wondrously. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.542-17.543"/>And Penelope laughed, and straightway spoke to Eumaeus winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.544"/>Go, pray, call the stranger here before me.

<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.545"/>Dost thou not note that my son has sneezed at all my words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.546-17.547"/>Therefore shall utter death fall upon the wooers one and all, nor shall one of them escape death and the fates. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.548"/>And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.549-17.550"/>If I find that he speaks all things truly,

<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.551"/>I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.552"/>So she spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying; and coming up to Odysseus he spoke to him winged words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.553-17.554"/>Sir stranger, wise Penelope calls for thee, the mother of Telemachus, and her heart

<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>
bids her make enquiry about her husband, though she has suffered many woes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.556-17.558"/>And if she finds that thou speakest all things truly, she will clothe thee in a cloak and tunic, which thou needest most of all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.558-17.559"/>As for thy food, thou shalt beg it through the land, and feed thy belly, and whoso will shall give it thee.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:17.560-17.606">

<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.560"/>Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.561-17.562"/>Eumaeus, soon will I tell all the truth to the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.563"/>For well do I know of Odysseus, and in common have we borne affliction. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.564-17.565"/>But I have fear of this throng of harsh wooers,

<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/>
whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.566-17.568"/>For even now, when, as I was going through the hall doing no evil, this man struck me and hurt me, neither Telemachus nor any other did aught to ward off the blow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.569-17.570"/>Wherefore now bid Penelope

<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/>
to wait in the halls, eager though she be, till set of sun; and then let her ask me of her husband regarding the day of his return, giving me a seat nearer the fire, for lo, the raiment that I wear is mean, and this thou knowest of thyself, for to thee first did I make my prayer.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.571-17.572"/>So he spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying.

<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.575"/>And as he passed over the threshold Penelope said to him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.576"/>Thou dost not bring him, Eumaeus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.576"/>What does the wanderer mean by this? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.577-17.578"/>Does he fear some one beyond measure, or does he idly feel ashamed in the house? 'Tis ill for a beggar to feel shame.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.578"/>To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:

<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.580-17.581"/>He speaks rightly, even as any other man would deem, in seeking to shun the insolence of overweening men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.582"/>But he bids thee to wait till set of sun. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.583-17.584"/>And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly, O queen, to speak to the stranger alone, and to hear his words.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.585"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.586"/>Not without wisdom is the stranger; he divines how it may be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.586"/>There are no mortal men, methinks, who in wantonness devise such wicked folly as these.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.587-17.588"/>So she spoke, and the goodly swineherd departed

<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line"/>
into the throng of the wooers when he had told her all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.591-17.592"/>And straightway he spoke winged words to Telemachus, holding his head close to him that the others might not hear:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.593-17.594"/>Friend, I am going forth to guard the swine and all things there, thy livelihood and mine; but have thou charge of all things here.

<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.595-17.596"/>Thine own self do thou keep safe first of all, and let thy mind beware lest some ill befall thee, for many of the Achaeans are devising evil, whom may Zeus utterly destroy before harm fall on us.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.596-17.597"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.598"/>So shall it be, father; go thy way when thou hast supped.

<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.600"/>And in the morning do thou come and bring goodly victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.602-17.605"/>So he spoke, and the swineherd sat down again on the polished chair. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went his way to the swine, and left the courts and the hall

<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line"/>
full of banqueters. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:17.605-17.606"/>And they were making merry with dance and song, for evening had now come on.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Now there came up a public beggar who was wont to beg through the town of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and was known for his greedy belly, eating and drinking without end. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>No strength had he nor might, but in bulk was big indeed to look upon.

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.5"/>Arnaeus was his name, for this name his honored mother had given him at his birth; but Irus all the young men called him, because he used to run on errands<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> when anyone bade him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.5-18.6"/>He came now, and was for driving Odysseus from his own house; and he began to revile him, and spoke winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.10"/>Give way, old man, from the doorway, lest soon thou be even dragged out by the foot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.11-18.12"/>Dost thou not see that all men are winking at me, and bidding me drag thee? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.12"/>Yet for myself, I am ashamed to do it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.13"/>Nay, up with thee, lest our quarrel even come to blows.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.14"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.15-18.16"/>Good fellow, I harm thee not in deed or word, nor do I begrudge that any man should give thee, though the portion he took up were a large one. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.17-18.18"/>This threshold will hold us both, and thou hast no need to be jealous for the goods of other folk. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.18-18.19"/>Thou seemest to me to be a vagrant, even as I am; and as for happy fortune, it is the gods that are like to give us that.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                            

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.20-18.22"/>But with thy fists do not provoke me overmuch, lest thou anger me, and, old man though I am, I befoul thy breast and lips with blood. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.22-18.23"/>So should I have the greater peace tomorrow, for I deem not that thou shalt return a second time to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.25"/>Then, waxing wroth, the vagrant Irus said to him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.26-18.27"/>Now see how glibly the filthy wretch talks, like an old kitchen-wife. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.27-18.29"/>But I will devise evil for him, smiting him left and right, and will scatter on the ground all the teeth from his jaws, as though he were a swine wasting the corn.

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.30-18.31"/>Gird thyself now, that these men, too, may all know our fighting. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.31"/>But how couldst thou fight with a younger man?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.32-18.33"/>Thus on the polished threshold before the lofty doors they stirred one another's rage right heartily. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.34-18.35"/>And the strong and mighty Antinous heard the two,

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
and, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among the wooers:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.36-18.37"/>Friends, never before has such a thing come to pass, that a god has brought sport like this to this house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.38-18.39"/>Yon stranger and Irus are provoking one another to blows. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.39"/>Come, let us quickly set them on.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.40-18.41"/>So he spoke, and they all sprang up laughing and gathered about the tattered beggars. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.42"/>And Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.43"/>Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.44-18.45"/>Here at the fire are goats' paunches lying, which

<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>
we set there for supper, when we had filled them with fat and blood. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.46-18.47"/>Now whichever of the two wins and proves himself the better man, let him rise and choose for himself which one of these he will. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.48-18.49"/>And furthermore he shall always feast with us, nor will we suffer any other beggar to join our company and beg of us.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.50"/>So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.51"/>Then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.52-18.53"/>Friends, in no wise may an old man that is overcome with woe fight with a younger. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.53-18.54"/>Howbeit my belly, that worker of evil, urges me on, that I may be overcome by his blows.

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.55-18.57"/>But come now, do you all swear to me a mighty oath, to the end that no man, doing a favour to Irus, may deal me a foul blow with heavy hand, and so by violence subdue me to this fellow.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.58"/>So he spoke, and they all gave the oath not to smite him, even as he bade. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.59-18.60"/>But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath,

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>
among them spoke again the strong and mighty Telemachus:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.61-18.63"/>Stranger, if thy heart and thy proud spirit bid thee beat off this fellow, then fear not thou any man of all the Achaeans, for whoso strikes thee shall have to fight with more than thou. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.64-18.65"/>Thy host am I, and the princes assent hereto,

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.66"/>Antinous and Eurymachus, men of prudence both.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.66-18.69"/>So he spoke, and they all praised his words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.69-18.70"/>But Odysseus girded his rags about his loins and showed his thighs, comely and great, and his broad shoulders came to view, and his chest and mighty arms. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And Athena

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
drew nigh and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.71"/>Then all the wooers marvelled exceedingly, and thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.72"/>Right soon shall Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own bringing, such a thigh does yon old man show from beneath his rags.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.75"/>So they spoke, and the mind of Irus was miserably shaken; yet even so the serving men girded him, and led him out perforce all filled with dread, and his flesh trembled on his limbs. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.76-18.77"/>Then Antinous rated him and spoke, and addressed him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.77"/>Better were it now, thou braggart, that thou wert not living, nor hadst ever been born,

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>
if thou quailest and art so terribly afraid of this fellow—a man that is old and overcome by the woe that has come upon him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.82"/>But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.83-18.87"/>If this fellow conquers thee and proves the better man, I will fling thee into a black ship and send thee to the mainland

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>
to King Echetus, the maimer of all men, who will cut off thy nose and ears with the pitiless bronze, and will draw forth thy vitals and give them raw to dogs to rend.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:18.88-18.123">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.88"/>So he spoke, and thereat yet greater trembling seized the other's limbs, and they led him into the ring and both men put up their hands.

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.90-18.92"/>Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was divided in mind whether he should strike him so that life should leave him even there as he fell, or whether he should deal him a light blow and stretch him on the earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.93-18.94"/>And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course, to deal him a light blow, that the Achaeans might not take note of him.

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.95-18.97"/>Then verily, when they had put up their hands, Irus let drive at the right shoulder, but Odysseus smote him on the neck beneath the ear and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.97-18.99"/>But the lordly wooers

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.100-18.102"/>Then Odysseus seized him by the foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway until he came to the court and the gates of the portico. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.102-18.103"/>And he set him down and leaned him against the wall of the court, and thrust his staff into his hand and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.105-18.107"/>Sit there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and do not thou be lord of strangers and beggars, miserable that thou art, lest haply thou meet with some worse thing to profit withal.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.108-18.109"/>He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, and slung by a twisted cord.

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.110"/>Then back to the threshold he went and sat down; and the wooers went within, laughing merrily, and they greeted him, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.110-18.111"/>May Zeus grant thee, stranger, and the other immortal gods what thou desirest most, and the dearest wish of thy heart, seeing that thou hast made this insatiate fellow to cease from begging

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
in the land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.115-18.116"/>For soon shall we take him to the mainland to King Echetus, the maimer of all men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.117"/>So they spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.118-18.119"/>And Antinous set before him the great paunch, filled with fat and blood, and Amphinomus

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
took up two loaves from the basket and set them before him, and pledged him in a cup of gold, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.122-18.123"/>Hail, Sir stranger; may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:18.124-18.168">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.123"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.125"/>Amphinomus, verily thou seemest to me to be a man of prudence; and such a man, too, was thy father, for I have heard of his fair fame, that Nisus of Dulichium was a brave man and a wealthy. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.126-18.127"/>From him, they say, thou art sprung, and thou seemest a man soft of speech. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.128"/>Wherefore I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.130-18.131"/>Nothing feebler does earth nurture than man, of all things that on earth are breathing and moving. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.132-18.133"/>For he thinks that he will never suffer evil in time to come, so long as the gods give him prosperity and his knees are quick; but when again the blessed gods decree him sorrow,

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
this too he bears in sore despite with steadfast heart; for the spirit of men upon the earth is even such as the day which the father of gods and men brings upon them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.136-18.137"/>For I, too, was once like to be prosperous among men, but many deeds of wantonness I wrought, yielding to my might and my strength,

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
and trusting in my father and my brethren. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.141-18.142"/>Wherefore let no man soever be lawless at any time, but let him keep in silence whatever gifts the gods give. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.143-18.146"/>Aye, for I see the wooers devising wantonness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
of a man who, I tell thee, will not long be away from his friends and his native land; nay, he is very near. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.146"/>But may some god lead thee forth hence to thy home, and mayest thou not meet him when he comes home to his dear native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.146-18.148"/>For not without bloodshed, methinks,

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>
will the wooers and he part one from the other when once he comes beneath his roof.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.151-18.152"/>So he spoke, and pouring a libation, drank of the honey-sweet wine, and then gave back the cup into the hands of the marshaller of the people. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.153-18.154"/>But Amphinomus went through the hall with a heavy heart, bowing his head; for his spirit boded bane.

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.155"/>Yet even so he did not escape his fate, but him, too, did Athena set in bonds so that he might be slain outright at the hands of Telemachus and by his spear. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.155-18.156"/>So he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.157"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put it in the heart of the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.163"/>Then she laughed a meaningless laugh and spoke, and addressed the nurse:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.164-18.165"/>Eurynome, my heart longs, though it has never longed before,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
to show myself to the wooers, hateful though they are. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.166-18.168"/>Also I would say a word to my son that will be for his profit, namely, that he should not consort ever with the overweening wooers, who speak him fair but have evil plans thereafter.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:18.169-18.205">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.169"/>Then the housewife, Eurynome, spoke to her and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.170"/>Aye, verily, child, all this hast thou spoken aright. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.171-18.172"/>Go, then, reveal thy word to thy son and hide it not; but first wash thy body and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with both cheeks stained with tears. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.173-18.174"/>Go, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing.

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.175-18.176"/>For now, behold, thy son is of such an age, and it has been thy dearest prayer to the immortals to see him a bearded man.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.177"/>Then wise Penelope answered her again: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.178-18.179"/>Eurynome, beguile me not thus in thy love to wash my body and anoint me with oil.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.180-18.181"/>All beauty of mine have the gods, that hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, destroyed since the day when my lord departed in the hollow ships. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.182-18.183"/>But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come to me, that they may stand by my side in the hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.184"/>Alone I will not go among men, for I am ashamed.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.185-18.186"/>So she spoke, and the old woman went forth through the chamber to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.187"/>Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.188-18.190"/>On the daughter of Icarius she shed sweet sleep, and she leaned back and slept

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
there on her couch, and all her joints were relaxed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.190-18.191"/>And meanwhile the fair goddess was giving her immortal gifts, that the Achaeans might marvel at her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.192-18.194"/>With balm<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> she first made fair her beautiful face, with balm ambrosial, such as that wherewith Cytherea, of the fair crown, anoints herself when she goes into the lovely dance of the Graces;

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
and she made her taller, too, and statelier to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.195-18.196"/>Now when she had done this the fair goddess departed, and the white-armed handmaids came forth from the chamber and drew near with sound of talking. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.197-18.199"/>Then sweet sleep released Penelope,

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
and she rubbed her cheeks with her hands, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.201"/>Ah, in my utter wretchedness soft slumber enfolded me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.202-18.205"/>Would that pure Artemis would even now give so soft a death, that I might no more waste my life away with sorrow at heart, longing for

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
the manifold excellence of my dear husband, for that he was pre-eminent among the Achaeans.</q></p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:18.206-18.249">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.206-18.207"/>So saying, she went down from the bright upper chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.207"/>Now when the fair lady reached the wooers she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall,

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
holding before her face her shining veil; and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.211"/>Straightway then the knees of the wooers were loosened and their hearts enchanted with love, and they all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.212-18.213"/>But she spoke to Telemachus, her dear son:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.215"/>Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer steadfast as heretofore. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.216"/>When thou wast but a child thou wast wont to revolve in thy mind thoughts more cunning; but now that thou art grown and hast reached the bounds of manhood, and wouldest be called a rich man's son by one who looked only to thy stature and thy comeliness, being himself a stranger from afar,

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer right as before. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.221-18.222"/>What a thing is this that has been done in these halls, that thou hast suffered yon stranger to be so maltreated! How now, if the stranger, while sitting thus in our house, should come to some harm through grievous mishandling?

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.225"/>On thee, then, would fall shame and disgrace among men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.226"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.227"/>My mother, in this matter I take it not ill that thou art filled with anger. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.228-18.229"/>Yet of myself I know in my heart and understand each thing, the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.230"/>But I am not able to plan all things wisely, for these men here thwart my will, keeping by me, one on this side and one on that, with evil purpose, and I have none to help me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.231-18.232"/>Howbeit, I can tell thee, this battle between the stranger and Irus fell not out according to the mind of the wooers, but the stranger proved the better man.

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.235-18.242"/>I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that even now the wooers were thus subdued in our halls, and were hanging their heads, some in the court and some within the hall, and that each man's limbs were loosened, even as Irus now sits yonder by the gate of the court,

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
hanging his head like a drunken man, and cannot stand erect upon his feet, or go home to whatsoever place he is wont to go, because his limbs are loosened.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.243"/>Thus they spoke to one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.244"/>But Eurymachus addressed Penelope, and said:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.250"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: <q><p>Eurymachus, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form, the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, and with them went my husband Odysseus.

greater would be my fame and fairer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.256"/>But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.256"/>Verily, when he went forth and left his native land, he clasped my right hand by the wrist, and said:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.257-18.258"/>Wife, I deem not that the well-greaved Achaeans

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
will all return from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> safe and unscathed, for the Trojans, men say, are men of war, hurlers of the spear, and drawers of the bow, and drivers of swift horses, such as most quickly decide the great strife of equal war.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.265-18.266"/>Therefore I know not whether the god will bring me back, or whether I shall be cut off there in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>: so have thou charge of all things here. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.266"/>Be mindful of my father and my mother in the halls even as thou art now, or yet more, while I am far away. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.267-18.268"/>But when thou shalt see my son a bearded man,

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
wed whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.</q></p>
<p>So he spoke, and now all this is being brought to pass. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.271"/>The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall fall to the lot of me accursed, whose happiness Zeus has taken away. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.271"/>But herein has bitter grief come upon my heart and soul,

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
for such as yours was never the way of wooers heretofore. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.275"/>They who are fain to woo a lady of worth and the daughter of a rich man and vie with one another, these bring of themselves cattle and goodly flocks, a banquet for the friends of the bride, and give to her glorious gifts;

but they do not devour the livelihood of another without atonement.</p></q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.280"/>So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, because she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls with gentle words, but her mind was set on other things.</p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.281-18.283"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to her again, and said:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.287"/>Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, as for gifts, if any man of the Achaeans is minded to bring them hither, do thou take them; for it is not well to refuse a gift.

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.290"/>So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them, and each man sent forth a herald to bring his gifts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.291"/>For Antinous he brought a large and beautiful robe, richly broidered, and in it were golden brooches, twelve in all, fitted with curved clasps.

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.295"/>And a chain did another straightway bring to Eurymachus, one cunningly wrought of gold, strung with amber beads, bright as the sun. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.296"/>A pair of earrings his squires brought to Eurydamas, with three clustering<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> drops, and great grace shone therefrom. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.297-18.298"/>And out of the house of lord Peisander, son of Polyctor,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
his squire brought a necklace, a jewel exceeding fair. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.301"/>So of the Achaeans one brought one fair gift and one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.302-18.305"/>But she thereafter, the fair lady, went up to her upper chamber, and her handmaids bare for her the beautiful gifts.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But the wooers

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>
turned to dance and gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited for evening to come on. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.306"/>And as they made merry dark evening came upon them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.307-18.308"/>Presently they set up three braziers in the hall to give them light, and round about them placed dry faggots, long since seasoned and hard, and newly split with the axe;

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
and in the spaces between they set torches;<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and in turn the handmaids of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart, kindled the flame. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.310-18.311"/>Then Zeus-born Odysseus, of many wiles, himself spoke among the maids, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.311-18.312"/>Maidens of Odysseus, that has long been gone, go to the chambers where your honored queen abides,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>
and twist the yarn by her side, and make glad her heart, as you sit in the chamber, or card the wool with your hands; but I will give light to all these men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.315-18.316"/>For if they wish to wait for fair-throned Dawn, they shall in no wise outdo me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.317"/>I am one that can endure much.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.320"/>So he spoke, and the maids broke into a laugh, and glanced at one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.321-18.323"/>And fair-cheeked Melantho rated him shamefully, Melantho, whom Dolius begot, but whom Penelope had reared and cherished as her own child, and gave her playthings to her heart's desire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.324-18.325"/>Yet even so she had at heart no sorrow for Penelope,

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
but she loved Eurymachus and was wont to lie with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.326"/>She then rated Odysseus with reviling words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.327-18.331"/>Wretched stranger, thou art but a crack-brained fellow, unwilling to go to a smithy to sleep, or to a common lodge, but pratest here continually,

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>
unabashed in the company of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.331-18.332"/>Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.332"/>Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.333"/>Beware, lest presently another better than Irus shall rise up against thee

to beat thee about the head with heavy hands, and befoul thee with streams of blood, and send thee forth from the house.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.337"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.338-18.339"/>Presently shall I go yonder, thou shameless thing, and tell Telemachus, since thou speakest thus, that on the spot he may cut thee limb from limb.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.340"/>So he spoke, and with his words scattered the women, who fled through the hall, and the limbs of each were loosened beneath her in terror, for they thought that he spoke truth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.341-18.342"/>But Odysseus took his stand by the burning braziers to give light, and looked upon all the men.

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.346-18.348"/>Yet other things was the heart within him pondering—things that were not to be unfulfilled.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.349-18.350"/>But Athena would in no wise suffer the proud wooers to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak,

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>
jeering at Odysseus, and making mirth for his companions:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.350"/>Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.351-18.352"/>Not without the will of the gods has this man come to the palace of Odysseus; in any case there is a glare of torches from him—

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
from his head, for there is no hair on it, no, not a trace.</q><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.356"/>Therewith he called to Odysseus, sacker of cities: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.357-18.359"/>Stranger, wouldest thou have a mind to serve for hire, if I should take thee into service on an outlying farm—thy pay shall be assured thee—gathering stones for walls, and planting tall trees?

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.360-18.361"/>There would I provide thee with food the year through, and clothe thee with raiment and give thee sandals for thy feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.362-18.364"/>But since thou hast learned only deeds of evil, thou wilt not care to busy thyself with work, but art minded rather to go skulking through the land, that thou mayest have wherewith to feed thy insatiate belly.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:18.365-18.393">

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.365"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.366-18.370"/>Eurymachus, I would that we two might have a match in working in the season of spring, when the long days come, at mowing the grass, I with a curved scythe in my hands and thou with another like it,

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
and that the grass might be in plenty that so we might test our work, fasting till late evening. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.371-18.374"/>Or I would again that there were oxen to drive—the best there are, tawny and large, both well fed with grass, of like age and like power to bear the yoke, tireless in strength—and that there were a field of four acres, and the soil should yield before the plough:

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
then shouldest thou see me, whether or no I could cut a straight furrow to the end. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.375"/>Or I would again that this day the son of Cronos might bring war upon us from whence he would, and I had a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, that fitted well my temples: then shouldest thou see me mingling amid the foremost fighters,

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
and wouldest not prate, taunting me with this belly of mine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.381"/>But right insolent art thou, and thy heart is cruel, and forsooth thou thinkest thyself to be some great man and mighty, because thou consortest with few men and weak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.382-18.383"/>If but Odysseus might return, and come to his native land,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
soon would yonder doors, right wide though they are, prove all too narrow for thee in thy flight out through the doorway.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.387-18.388"/>So he spoke, and Eurymachus waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.389-18.391"/>Wretch, presently will I work thee evil, that thou pratest thus,

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
unabashed in the presence of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.391-18.392"/>Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.392"/>Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus?</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.393"/>So saying, he seized a footstool, but Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
sat down at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, in fear of Eurymachus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.396-18.397"/>And so Eurymachus struck a cup-bearer on the right hand, and the wine-jug fell to the ground with a clang, and the bearer groaned, and fell backwards in the dust. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.397-18.398"/>Then the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
and thus would one man speak with a glance at his neighbor: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.401-18.402"/>Would that yon stranger had perished elsewhere on his wanderings or ever he came hither; then should he never have brought among us all this tumult. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.402"/>But now we are brawling about beggars, nor shall there be any joy in our rich feast, since worse things prevail.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.405-18.407"/>Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.407"/>Strange sirs, ye are mad, and no longer hide that ye have eaten and drunk; some god surely is moving you. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.408-18.409"/>Nay, now that you have well feasted, go to your homes and take your rest, when your spirits bid you. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.409"/>Yet do I drive no man forth.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.410-18.411"/>So he spoke, and they all bit their lips, and marvelled at Telemachus, that he spoke boldly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.412-18.413"/>But Amphinomus spoke, and addressed them—he was son of the noble prince Nisus, son of Aretias:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.414-18.415"/>Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.416-18.417"/>Abuse not any more this stranger nor any one of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.418-18.419"/>Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation in the cups, that we may pour libations, and go home to take our rest. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>As for this stranger,

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
let us leave him in the halls of Odysseus to be cared for by Telemachus; for to his house has he come.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.420-18.421"/>So said he, and the words that he spoke were pleasing to all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.421"/>Then a bowl was mixed for them by the lord Mulius, a herald from Dulichium, who was squire to Amphinomus.

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.425"/>And he served out to all, coming up to each in turn; and they made libations to the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:18.425-18.426"/>Then when they had made libations and had drunk to their heart's content, they went their way, each man to his own house, to take their rest.</p>

<milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers, and he straightway spoke winged words to Telemachus:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Telemachus, the weapons of war thou must needs lay away within

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
one and all, and when the wooers miss them and question thee, thou must beguile them with gentle words, saying: ‘Out of the smoke have I laid them, since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him, when he went forth to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but are all befouled, so far as the breath of fire has reached them.

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.10-19.13"/>And furthermore this greater fear has a god put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you, and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.13"/>For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’</q> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.14-19.15"/>So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
and calling forth the nurse Eurycleia, said to her:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.16-19.19"/>Nurse, come now, I bid thee, shut up the women in their rooms, while I lay away in the store-room the weapons of my father, the goodly weapons which all uncared-for the smoke bedims in the hall since my father went forth, and I was still a child.

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.20"/>But now I am minded to lay them away, where the breath of the fire will not come upon them.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.21"/>Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.22-19.23"/>Aye, child, I would thou mightest ever take thought to care for the house and guard all its wealth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.24"/>But come, who then shall fetch a light and bear it for thee,

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
since thou wouldest not suffer the maids, who might have given light, to go before thee?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.25"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her; <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.26"/>This stranger here; for I will suffer no man to be idle who touches my portion of meal,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> even though he has come from afar.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.27"/>So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged, and she locked the doors of the stately hall.

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.30"/>Then the two sprang up, Odysseus and his glorious son, and set about bearing within the helmets and the bossy shields and the sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athena, bearing a golden lamp, made a most beauteous light.

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.35"/>Then Telemachus suddenly spoke to his father, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.36"/>Father, verily this is a great marvel that my eyes behold; certainly the walls of the house and the fair beams<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> and cross-beams of fir and the pillars that reach on high, glow in my eyes as with the light of blazing fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.50"/>There now too he lay down and waited for the bright Dawn.

and for her they set by the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair inlaid with spirals of ivory and silver, which of old the craftsman Icmalius had made, and had set beneath it a foot-stool for the feet, that was part of the chair, and upon it a great fleece was wont to be laid. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.55-19.56"/>On this then wise Penelope sat down,

and the white-armed maids came forth from the women's hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.66-19.67"/>Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us through the night, roaming through the house, and wilt thou spy upon the women? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.68"/>Nay, get thee forth, thou wretch, and be content with thy supper, or straightway shalt thou even be smitten with a torch, and so go forth.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.70"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.71"/>Good woman, why, pray, dost thou thus assail me with angry heart? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.72-19.73"/>Is it because I am foul and wear mean raiment on my body, and beg through the land? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.73"/>Aye, for necessity compels me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.74-19.77"/>Of such sort are beggars and vagabond folk.

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.78-19.79"/>For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men, a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Slaves too I had past counting and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.80"/>But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught; so, I ween, was his good pleasure. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.80"/>Wherefore, woman, beware lest thou too some day lose all the glory whereby thou now hast excellence among the handmaids; lest perchance thy mistress wax wroth and be angry with thee, or Odysseus come home; for there is yet room for hope.

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.85-19.87"/>But if, even as it seems, he is dead, and is no more to return, yet now is his son by the favour of Apollo such as he was—even Telemachus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.87-19.88"/>Him it escapes not if any of the women in the halls work wantonness; for he is no longer the child he was.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.89-19.90"/>So he spoke, and wise Penelope heard him;

and she rebuked the handmaid and spoke, and addressed her:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.91-19.92"/>Be sure, thou bold and shameless thing, that thy outrageous deed is in no wise hid from me, and with thine own head shalt thou wipe out its stain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.93-19.95"/>Full well didst thou know, for thou hast heard it from my own lips, that I was minded

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>
to question the stranger in my halls concerning my husband; for I am sore distressed.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.96"/>With this she spoke also to the housewife Eurynome, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.97-19.99"/>Eurynome, bring hither a chair and a fleece upon it, that the stranger may sit down and tell his tale, and listen to me; for I am fain to ask him of all things.</q> 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.100-19.101"/>So she spoke, and Eurynome speedily brought a polished chair and set it in place, and on it cast a fleece. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.102"/>Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus sat down upon it, and the wise Penelope spoke first, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.103"/>Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first.

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.105"/>Who art thou among men, and from whence? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.105"/>Where is thy city, and where thy parents?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.106"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.107-19.108"/>Lady, no one of mortals upon the boundless earth could find fault with thee, for thy fame goes up to the broad heaven, as does the fame of some blameless king, who with the fear of the gods in his heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>
is lord over many mighty men, upholding justice; and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the trees are laden with fruit, the flocks bring forth young unceasingly, and the sea yields fish, all from his good leading; and the people prosper under him.

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.115-19.118"/>Wherefore question me now in thy house of all things else, but ask not concerning my race and my native land, lest thou fill my heart the more with pains, as I think thereon; for I am a man of many sorrows. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.118-19.120"/>Moreover it is not fitting

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
that I should sit weeping and wailing in another's house, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.121-19.122"/>I would not that one of thy maidens or thine own self be vexed with me, and say that I swim in tears because my mind is heavy with wine.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.123"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: <q><p>Stranger, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form,

the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, and with them went my husband, Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.129"/>If he might but come, and watch over this life of mine, greater would be my fame and fairer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.129"/>But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.130-19.133"/>For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who dwell around in clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, all these woo me against my will, and lay waste my house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.134-19.135"/>Wherefore I pay no heed to strangers or to suppliants

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
or in any wise to heralds, whose trade is a public one; but in longing for Odysseus I waste my heart away. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.136"/>So these men urge on my marriage, and I wind a skein of wiles. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.137"/>First some god breathed the thought in my heart to set up a great web in my halls and fall to weaving a robe—

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and I straightway spoke among them:</p><p>
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.140"/>Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when

the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any one of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he were to lie without a shroud, who had won great possessions.</q></p></q></p>

    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.146-19.147"/>So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.148"/>Then day by day I would weave at the great web,

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>
but by night would unravel it, when I had let place torches by me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.151"/>Thus for three years I kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned, and the many days were brought in their course, then verily by the help of my maidens, shameless creatures and reckless,

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
they came upon me and caught me, and upbraided me loudly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.156"/>So I finished the web against my will perforce. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.157-19.158"/>And now I can neither escape the marriage nor devise any counsel more, and my parents are pressing me to marry, and my son frets, while these men devour his livelihood,

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
as he takes note of it all; for by now he is a man, and fully able to care for a household to which Zeus grants honor. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.160-19.161"/>Yet even so tell me of thy stock from whence thou art; for thou art not sprung from an oak of ancient story, or from a stone.</q><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.162"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
 <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.165-19.166"/>Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, wilt thou never cease to ask me of my lineage? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.167"/>Well, I will tell thee; though verily thou wilt give me over to pains yet more than those by which I am now held in thrall; for so it ever is, when a man has been far from his country as long as I have now,

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
wandering through the many cities of men in sore distress. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.171"/>Yet even so will I tell thee what thou dost ask and enquire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.172-19.173"/>There is a land called <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities.

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.175"/>They have not all the same speech, but their tongues are mixed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.175-19.177"/>There dwell Achaeans, there great-hearted native Cretans, there Cydonians, and Dorians of waving plumes, and goodly Pelasgians. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.178-19.181"/>Among their cities is the great city Cnosus, where Minos reigned when nine years old,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> he that held converse with great Zeus,

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
and was father of my father, great-hearted Deucalion. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.182-19.184"/>Now Deucalion begat me and prince Idomeneus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.184"/>Idomeneus had gone forth in his beaked ships to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> with the sons of Atreus; but my famous name is Aethon; I was the younger by birth, while he was the elder and the better man.

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.185"/>There it was that I saw Odysseus and gave him gifts of entertainment; for the force of the wind had brought him too to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, as he was making for the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and drove him out of his course past Malea. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.186-19.187"/>So he anchored his ships at Amnisus, where is the cave of Eilithyia, in a difficult harbor, and hardly did he escape the storm.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.190"/>Then straightway he went up to the city and asked for Idomeneus; for he declared that he was his friend, beloved and honored. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.191"/>But it was now the tenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus had gone in his beaked ships to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.192-19.193"/>So I took him to the house, and gave him entertainment

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
with kindly welcome of the rich store that was in the house, and to the rest of his comrades who followed with him I gathered and gave out of the public store barley meal and flaming wine and bulls for sacrifice, that their hearts might be satisfied. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.196-19.198"/>There for twelve days the goodly Achaeans tarried,

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
for the strong North Wind penned them there, and would not suffer them to stand upon their feet on the land, for some angry god had roused it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.200-19.201"/>But on the thirteenth day the wind fell and they put to sea.</p></q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.202"/>He spoke, and made the many falsehoods of his tale seem like the truth,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> and as she listened her tears flowed and her face melted

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
as the snow melts on the lofty mountains, the snow which the East Wind thaws when the West Wind has strewn it, and as it melts the streams of the rivers flow full: so her fair cheeks melted as she wept and mourned for her husband, who even then was sitting by her side. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.205-19.206"/>And Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
in his heart had pity for his weeping wife, but his eyes stood fixed between his lids as though they were horn or iron, and with guile he hid his tears. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.212"/>But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, again answered him and spoke, saying:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.215-19.217"/>Now verily, stranger, am I minded to put thee to the test, whether or no thou didst in very truth entertain there in thy halls my husband with his godlike comrades, even as thou sayest. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.218-19.219"/>Tell me what manner of raiment he wore about his body, and what manner of man he was himself; and tell me of the comrades who followed him.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.220"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.221-19.222"/>Lady, hard is it for one that has been so long afar to tell thee this, for it is now the twentieth year since he went thence and departed from my country. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.222-19.223"/>But I will tell thee as my mind pictures him.

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.225-19.226"/>A fleecy cloak of purple did goodly Odysseus wear, a cloak of double fold, but the brooch upon it was fashioned of gold with double clasps, and on the front it was curiously wrought: a hound held in his fore paws a dappled fawn, and pinned it<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> in his jaws as it writhed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.226-19.227"/>And at this all men marvelled,

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
how, though they were of gold, the hound was pinning the fawn and strangling it, and the fawn was writhing with its feet and striving to flee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.232-19.233"/>And I noted the tunic about his body, all shining as is the sheen upon the skin of a dried onion, so soft it was; and it glistened like the sun.

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.235"/>Verily many women gazed at him in wonder. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.236"/>And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.237-19.240"/>I know not whether Odysseus was thus clothed at home, or whether one of his comrades gave him the raiment when he went on board the swift ship, or haply even some stranger, since to many men

was Odysseus dear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers.</q></p>

                        <p><q>
     

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.240"/>I, too, gave him a sword of bronze, and a fair purple cloak of double fold, and a fringed tunic, and with all honor sent him forth on his benched ship. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.241-19.243"/>Furthermore, a herald

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
attended him, a little older than he, and I will tell thee of him too, what manner of man he was. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.245"/>He was round-shouldered, dark of skin, and curly-haired, and his name was Eurybates; and Odysseus honored him above his other comrades, because he was like-minded with himself.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.246-19.247"/>So he spoke, and in her heart aroused yet more the desire of weeping,

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
as she recognized the sure tokens that Odysseus told her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.251"/>But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, made answer and said to him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.252"/>Now verily, stranger, though before thou wast pitied, shalt thou be dear and honored in my halls,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
for it was I that gave him this raiment, since thou describest it thus, and folded it, and brought it forth from the store-room, and added thereto the shining brooch to be a thing of joy to him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.255-19.257"/>But my husband I shall never welcome back, returning home to his dear native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.257-19.258"/>Wherefore it was with an evil fate that Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
went forth in the hollow ship to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, that should never be named.</q></p><p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.261"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.262-19.264"/>Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mar not now thy fair face any more, nor waste thy heart at all in weeping for thy husband. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.264"/>I count it indeed no blame in thee;

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>
for any woman weeps when she has lost her wedded husband, to whom she has borne children in her love, though he were far other than Odysseus, who, they say, is like unto the gods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.265-19.267"/>Yet do thou cease from weeping, and hearken to my words; for I will tell thee with sure truth, and will hide nothing,

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
how but lately I heard of the return of Odysseus, that he is near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians, and yet alive, and he is bringing with him many rich treasures, as he begs through the land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.272-19.273"/>But he lost his trusty comrades and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea,

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
as he journeyed from the isle Thrinacia; for Zeus and Helios waxed wroth against him because his comrades had slain the kine of Helios.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.275-19.276"/>So they all perished in the surging sea, but he on the keel of his ship was cast forth by the wave on the shore, on the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods.

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.282-19.283"/>These heartily showed him all honor, as if he were a god, and gave him many gifts, and were fain themselves to send him home unscathed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.283-19.284"/>Yea, and Odysseus would long since have been here, only it seemed to his mind more profitable to gather wealth by roaming over the wide earth;

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>
so truly does Odysseus beyond all mortal men know many gainful ways, nor could any mortal beside vie with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.285-19.286"/>Thus Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me the tale. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.287"/>Moreover he swore in my own presence, as he poured libations in his halls, that the ship was launched and the men ready

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>
who were to convey him to his dear native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.291"/>But me he sent forth first, for a ship of the Thesprotians chanced to be setting out for Dulichium, rich in wheat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.291-19.292"/>And he showed me all the treasure that Odysseus had gathered; verily unto the tenth generation would it feed his children after him,

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>
so great was the wealth that lay stored for him in the halls of the king. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.296-19.299"/>But Odysseus, he said, had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> to hear the will of Zeus from the high-crested oak of the god, even how he might return to his dear native land after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.</p>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
<p>Thus, as I tell thee, he is safe, and will presently come; he is very near, and not long will he now be far from his friends and his native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.300-19.302"/>Yet will I give thee an oath. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.302"/>Be Zeus my witness first, highest and best of gods, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.310-19.311"/>Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one who met thee would call thee blessed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.312"/>Yet in my heart I forebode it thus, even as it shall be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.313-19.316"/>Neither shall Odysseus any more come home, nor shalt thou obtain a convoy hence, since there are not now in the house such masters

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.386-19.388"/>So he spoke, and the old dame took the shining cauldron with water wherefrom she was about to wash his feet, and poured in cold water in plenty, and then added thereto the warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.390-19.391"/>So she drew near and began to wash her lord, and straightway knew the scar of the wound which long ago a boar had dealt him with his white tusk, when Odysseus had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> to visit Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus,

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
his mother's noble father, who excelled all men in thievery and in oaths. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.396-19.397"/>It was a god himself that had given him this skill, even Hermes, for to him he was wont to burn acceptable sacrifices of the thighs of lambs and kids; so Hermes befriended him with a ready heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.405"/>Then Autolycus answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.413"/>It was for this reason that Odysseus had come, that Autolycus might give him the glorious gifts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.414-19.415"/>And Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
clasped his hands in welcome and greeted him with gentle words, and Amphithea, his mother's mother, took Odysseus in her arms and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.416-19.417"/>But Autolycus called to his glorious sons to make ready the meal, and they hearkened to his call.

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.421-19.423"/>At once they led in a bull, five years old, which they flayed and dressed, and cut up all the limbs. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.424-19.425"/>Then they sliced these cunningly and pierced them with spits, and roasted them skilfully and distributed the portions. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>So, then, all day long till set of sun

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
they feasted, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.426-19.427"/>But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to rest and took the gift of sleep.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.428-19.430"/>But as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they went forth to the hunt, the hounds and

the sons of Autolycus too, and with them went goodly Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.430-19.431"/>Up the steep mountain <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, clothed with forests, they climbed, and presently reached its windy hollows. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.431-19.432"/>The sun was now just striking on the fields, as he rose from softly-gliding, deep-flowing Oceanus,

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>
when the beaters came to a glade. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.435-19.437"/>Before them went the hounds, tracking the scent, and behind them the sons of Autolycus, and among these the goodly Odysseus followed, close upon the hounds, brandishing his long spear. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.437-19.438"/>Now thereby a great wild boar was lying in a thick lair,

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
through which the strength of the wet winds could never blow nor the rays of the bright sun beat, nor could the rain pierce through it, so thick it was; and fallen leaves were there in plenty. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.440-19.442"/>Then about the boar there came the noise of the feet of men and dogs

as they pressed on in the chase, and forth from his lair he came against them with bristling back and eyes flashing fire, and stood there at bay close before them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.445-19.447"/>Then first of all Odysseus rushed on, holding his long spear on high in his stout hand, eager to smite him; but the boar was too quick for him and struck him

above the knee, charging upon him sideways, and with his tusk tore a long gash in the flesh, but did not reach the bone of the man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.452-19.453"/>But Odysseus with sure aim smote him on the right shoulder, and clear through went the point of the bright spear, and the boar fell in the dust with a cry, and his life flew from him.</p>

how, while he was hunting, a boar had struck him with his white tusk when he had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> with the sons of Autolycus.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.467-19.468"/>This scar the old dame, when she had taken the limb in the flat of her hands, knew by the touch, and she let fall the foot. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.469-19.470"/>Into the basin the leg fell, and the brazen vessel rang.

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.470"/>Over it tilted, and the water was spilled upon the ground. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.471-19.472"/>Then upon her soul came joy and grief in one moment, and both her eyes were filled with tears and the flow of her voice was checked. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.473"/>But she touched the chin of Odysseus, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.478"/>But Penelope could not meet her glance nor understand, for Athena had turned her thoughts aside. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.479"/>But Odysseus,

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
feeling for the woman's throat, seized it with his right hand, and with the other drew her closer to him, and said:

for it will soon be the hour for pleasant rest, for him at least on whom sweet sleep may come despite his care.

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>
but when night comes and sleep lays hold of all, I lie upon my bed, and sharp cares, crowding close about my throbbing heart, disquiet me, as I mourn. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.515-19.517"/>Even as when the daughter of Pandareus, the nightingale of the greenwood,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> sings sweetly, when spring is newly come,

as she sits perched amid the thick leafage of the trees, and with many trilling notes pours forth her rich voice in wailing for her child, dear Itylus, whom she had one day slain with the sword unwittingly, Itylus, the son of king Zethus; even so my heart sways to and fro in doubt,

<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>
whether to abide with my son and keep all things safe, my possessions, my slaves, and my great, high-roofed house, respecting the bed of my husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans, who woos me in the halls and offers bride-gifts past counting.

<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.530-19.531"/>Furthermore my son, so long as he was a child and slack of wit, would not suffer me to marry and leave the house of my husband; but now that he is grown and has reached the bounds of manhood, lo, he even prays me to go back again from these halls, being vexed for his substance that the Achaeans devour to his cost.

<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>

<q>

deceive men, bringing words that find no fulfillment.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>

and give me joy, sleep should never be shed over my eyelids. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.591-19.592"/>But it is in no wise possible that men should forever be sleepless, for the immortals have appointed a proper time for each thing upon the earth, the giver of grain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:19.592-19.593"/>But I verily will go to my upper chamber

<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line"/>
and lay me on my bed, which has become for me a bed of wailings, ever bedewed with my tears, since the day when Odysseus went to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, that should never be named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But the goodly Odysseus lay down to sleep in the fore-hall of the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>On the ground he spread an undressed ox-hide and above it many fleeces of sheep, which the Achaeans were wont to slay, and Eurynome threw over him a cloak, when he had laid him down.

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.5-20.6"/>There Odysseus, pondering in his heart evil for the wooers, lay sleepless. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.6-20.8"/>And the women came forth from the hall, those that had before been wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and merriment among themselves. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.9"/>But the heart was stirred in his breast,

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>
and much he debated in mind and heart, whether he should rush after them and deal death to each, or suffer them to lie with the insolent wooers for the last and latest time; and his heart growled within him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.10-20.13"/>And as a bitch stands over her tender whelps

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>
growling, when she sees a man she does not know, and is eager to fight, so his heart growled within him in his wrath at their evil deeds; but he smote his breast, and rebuked his heart, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.17"/>Endure, my heart; a worse thing even than this didst thou once endure on that day when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, unrestrained in daring, devoured my

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.20-20.21"/>So he spoke, chiding the heart in his breast, and his heart remained bound<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> within him to endure steadfastly; but he himself lay tossing this way and that.

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.25-20.30"/>And as when a man before a great blazing fire turns swiftly this way and that a paunch full of fat and blood, and is very eager to have it roasted quickly, so Odysseus tossed from side to side, pondering how he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers,

<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>
one man as he was against so many. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.30-20.31"/>Then Athena came down from heaven and drew near to him in the likeness of a woman, and she stood above his head, and spoke to him, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.31"/>Why now again art thou wakeful, ill-fated above all men? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.32"/>Lo, this is thy house, and here within is thy wife

and thy child, such a man, methinks, as anyone might pray to have for his son.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.36"/>And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.37"/>Yea, goddess, all this hast thou spoken aright. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.38-20.40"/>But the heart in my breast is pondering somewhat upon this, how I may put forth my hands upon the shameless wooers,

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
all alone as I am, while they remain always in a body in the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.40"/>And furthermore this other and harder thing I ponder in my mind: even if I were to slay them by the will of Zeus and of thyself, where then should I find escape from bane? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.41"/>Of this I bid thee take thought.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.42-20.43"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.45-20.46"/>Obstinate one, many a man puts his trust even in a weaker friend than I am, one that is mortal, and knows not such wisdom as mine; but I am a god, that guard thee to the end in all thy toils. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.47-20.48"/>And I will tell thee openly; if fifty troops of mortal men

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>
should stand about us, eager to slay us in battle, even their cattle and goodly sheep shouldest thou drive off. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.52"/>Nay, let sleep now come over thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.52-20.53"/>There is weariness also in keeping wakeful watch the whole night through; and even now shalt thou come forth from out thy perils.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.54-20.55"/>So she spoke, and shed sleep upon his eyelids,

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
but herself, the fair goddess, went back to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.56-20.57"/>Now while sleep seized him, loosening the cares of his heart, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his true-hearted wife awoke, and wept, as she sat upon her soft bed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.58"/>But when her heart had had its fill of weeping,

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>
to Artemis first of all the fair lady made her prayer:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.61-20.65"/>Artemis, mighty goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that now thou wouldest fix thy arrow in my breast and take away my life even in this hour; or that a storm-wind might catch me up and bear me hence over the murky ways,

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>
and cast me forth at the mouth of backward-flowing Oceanus, even as on a time storm-winds bore away the daughters of Pandareus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.66"/>Their parents the gods had slain, and they were left orphans in the halls, and fair Aphrodite tended them with cheese, and sweet honey, and pleasant wine,

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
and Here gave them beauty and wisdom above all women, and chaste Artemis gave them stature, and Athena taught them skill in famous handiwork. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.70-20.72"/>But while beautiful Aphrodite was going to high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> to ask for the maidens the accomplishment of gladsome marriage—

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
going to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt, for well he knows all things, both the happiness and the haplessness of mortal men—meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched away the maidens and gave them to the hateful Erinyes to deal with.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.79-20.82"/>Would that even so those who have dwellings on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> would blot me from sight,

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>
or that fair-tressed Artemis would smite me, so that with Odysseus before my mind I might even pass beneath the hateful earth, and never gladden in any wise the heart of a baser man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.83-20.87"/>Yet when a man weeps by day with a heart sore distressed,

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>
but at night sleep holds him, this brings with it an evil that may well be borne—for sleep makes one forget all things, the good and the evil, when once it envelops the eyelids—but upon me a god sends evil dreams as well. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.88-20.89"/>For this night again there lay by my side one like him, even such as he was when he went forth with the host, and my heart

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
was glad, for I deemed it was no dream, but the truth at last.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.91"/>So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.92"/>But as she wept goodly Odysseus heard her voice, and thereupon he mused, and it seemed to his heart that she knew him and was standing by his head.

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.95-20.97"/>Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he was lying and laid them on a chair in the hall, and carried the ox-hide out of doors and set it down; and he lifted up his hands and prayed to Zeus:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.98-20.101"/>Father Zeus, if of your good will ye gods have brought me over land and sea to my own country, when ye had afflicted me sore,

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
let some one of those who are awaking utter a word of omen for me within, and without let a sign from Zeus be shown besides.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.102"/>So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the counsellor heard him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.102-20.104"/>Straightway he thundered from gleaming <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, from on high from out the clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad.

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.105-20.108"/>And a woman, grinding at the mill, uttered a word of omen from within the house hard by, where the mills of the shepherd of the people were set. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.109-20.110"/>At these mills twelve women in all were wont to ply their tasks, making meal of barley and of wheat, the marrow of men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Now the others were sleeping, for they had ground their wheat,

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>
but she alone had not yet ceased, for she was the weakest of all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.111"/>She now stopped her mill and spoke a word, a sign for her master:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.112-20.114"/>Father Zeus, who art lord over gods and men, verily loud hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there any cloud: surely this is a sign that thou art showing to some man.

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.115"/>Fulfil now even for wretched me the word that I shall speak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.116-20.118"/>May the wooers this day for the last and latest time hold their glad feast in the halls of Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.118-20.119"/>They that have loosened my limbs with bitter labour, as I made them barley meal, may they now sup their last.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.120-20.121"/>So she spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen and at the thunder of Zeus, for he thought he had gotten vengeance on the guilty.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.121"/>Now the other maidens in the fair palace of Odysseus had gathered together and were kindling on the hearth unwearied fire, and Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man,

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>
and put on his clothing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.125"/>He slung his sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his shining feet he bound his fair sandals; and he took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, and went and stood upon the threshold, and spoke to Eurycleia:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.126-20.127"/>Dear nurse, have ye honored the stranger in our house

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>
with bed and food, or does he lie all uncared for? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.131"/>For such is my mother's way, wise though she is: in wondrous fashion she honours one of mortal men, though he be the worse, while the better she sends unhonored away.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:20.133-20.182">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.132"/>Then wise Eurycleia answered him:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.135"/>In this matter, child, thou shouldest not blame her, who is without blame. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.136-20.137"/>He sat here and drank wine as long as he would, but for food he said he had no more hunger, for she asked him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.137"/>But when he bethought him of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew his bed.

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.143"/>But he, as one wholly wretched and hapless, would not sleep on a bed and under blankets, but on an undressed ox-hide and fleeces of sheep he slept in the fore-hall, and we flung over him a cloak.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.144-20.145"/>So she spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.146"/>And he went his way to the place of assembly to join the company of the well-greaved Achaeans, but Eurycleia, the goodly lady, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor, called to her maidens, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.147-20.148"/>Come, let some of you busily sweep the hall

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>
and sprinkle it, and throw on the shapely chairs coverlets of purple, and let others wipe all the tables with sponges and cleanse the mixing-bowls and the well-wrought double cups, and others still go to the spring for water and bring it quickly here.

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.155-20.156"/>For the wooers will not long be absent from the hall, but will return right early; for it is a feast-day for all men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.157"/>So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.158-20.159"/>Twenty of them went to the spring of dark water, and the others busied themselves there in the house in skilful fashion.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.160"/>Then in came the serving-men of the Acheans, who thereafter split logs of wood well and skilfully; and the women came back from the spring. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.160-20.162"/>After them came the swineherd, driving three boars which were the best in all his herd. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.162-20.163"/>These he let be to feed in the fair courts,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
but himself spoke to Odysseus with gentle words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.166-20.167"/>Stranger, do the Achaeans look on thee with any more regard, or do they dishonor thee in the halls as before?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.168"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.169-20.171"/>Ah, Eumaeus, I would that the gods might take vengeance on the outrage

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
wherewith these men in wantonness devise wicked folly in another's house, and have no place for shame.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.172-20.173"/>Thus they spoke to one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.174-20.175"/>And near to them came Melanthius the goatherd, leading she-goats that were the best in all the herds,

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
to make a feast for the wooers, and two herdsmen followed with him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.175"/>The goats he tethered beneath the echoing portico, and himself spoke to Odysseus with taunting words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.176-20.177"/>Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us here in the hall, asking alms of men, and wilt thou not begone?

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
'Tis plain, methinks, that we two shall not part company till we taste one another's fists, for thy begging is in no wise decent. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.180-20.182"/>Also it is not here alone that there are feasts of the Achaeans.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.182"/>So he spoke, but Odysseus of many wiles made no answer, but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.185-20.186"/>Besides these a third man came, Philoetius, a leader of men, driving for the wooers a barren heifer and fat she-goats. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.187-20.188"/>These had been brought over from the mainland by ferrymen, who send other men, too, on their way, whosoever comes to them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.189-20.190"/>The beasts he tethered carefully beneath the echoing portico,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
but himself came close to the swineherd and questioned him, saying: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.191-20.192"/>Who is this stranger, swineherd, who has newly come to our house? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.192-20.193"/>From what men does he declare himself to be sprung? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.193"/>Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.194"/>Hapless man! Yet truly in form he is like a royal prince;

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
howbeit the gods bring to misery far-wandering men, whenever they spin for them the threads of trouble, even though they be kings.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.195-20.196"/>Therewith he drew near to Odysseus, and stretching forth his right hand in greeting, spoke and addressed him with winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.197-20.198"/>Hail, Sir stranger;

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows! Father Zeus, no other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no pity on men when thou hast thyself given them birth, but bringest them into misery and wretched pains. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.200"/>The sweat broke out on me when I marked the man, and my eyes are full of tears

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>
as I think of Odysseus; for he, too, I ween, is clothed in such rags and is a wanderer among men, if indeed he still lives and beholds the light of the sun. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.208-20.210"/>But if he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for blameless Odysseus, who

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>
set me over his cattle, when I was yet a boy, in the land of the Cephallenians And now these wax past counting; in no other wise could the breed of broad-browed cattle yield better increase<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> for a mortal man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.211-20.212"/>But strangers bid me drive these now for themselves to eat, and they care nothing for the son in the house,

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
nor do they tremble at the wrath of the gods, for they are eager now to divide among themselves the possessions of our lord that has long been gone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.215-20.216"/>Now, as for myself, the heart in my breast keeps revolving this matter: a very evil thing it is, while the son lives, to depart along with my cattle and go to a land of strangers,

even to an alien folk; but this is worse still, to remain here and suffer woes in charge of cattle that are given over to others. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.220-20.221"/>Aye, verily, long ago would I have fled and come to some other of the proud kings, for now things are no more to be borne; but still I think of that hapless one, if perchance he might come back I know not whence,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.230-20.232"/>Now be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily while thou art here Odysseus shall come home, and thou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying of the wooers, who lord it here.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.235"/>Then the herdsman of the cattle answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.236"/>Ah, stranger, I would that the son of Cronos might fulfil this word of thine! Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.237"/>And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus might come back to his own home.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.240-20.242"/>Thus they spoke to one another, but the wooers meanwhile were plotting death and fate for Telemachus; howbeit there came to them a bird on their left, an eagle of lofty flight, clutching a timid dove. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.242-20.243"/>Then Amphinomus spoke in their assembly, and said: 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.245-20.246"/>Friends, this plan of ours will not run to our liking, even the slaying of Telemachus; nay, let us bethink us of the feast.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.246"/>So spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.247"/>Then, going into the house of godlike Odysseus, they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted swine, and the heifer of the herd. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.252-20.253"/>Then they roasted the entrails and served them out, and mixed wine in the bowls, and the swineherd handed out the cups. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.253"/>And Philoetius, a leader of men, handed them bread

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
in a beautiful basket, and Melanthius poured them wine. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.256"/>So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.257-20.259"/>But Telemachus, with crafty thought, made Odysseus sit within the well-built hall by the threshold of stone, and placed for him a mean stool and a little table.

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.260-20.261"/>Beside him he set portions of the entrails and poured wine in a cup of gold, and said to him:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.262"/>Sit down here among the lords and drink thy wine, and the revilings and blows of all the wooers will I myself ward from thee; for this is no public

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.266-20.267"/>And for your part, ye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes and blows, that no strife or quarrel may arise.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.268-20.269"/>So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus for that he spoke boldly;

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.270"/>Hard though it be, Achaeans, let us accept the word of Telemachus, though boldly he threatens us in his speech. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.271-20.272"/>For Zeus, son of Cronos, did not suffer it, else would we ere now have silenced him in the halls, clear-voiced talker though he is.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.275"/>So spoke Antinous, but Telemachus paid no heed to his words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.275"/>Meanwhile the heralds were leading through the city the holy hecatomb of the gods, and the long-haired Achaeans gathered together beneath a shady grove of Apollo, the archer-god.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.276-20.277"/>But when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits,

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.281-20.282"/>And by Odysseus those who served set a portion equal to that which they received themselves, for so Telemachus commanded, the dear son of divine Odysseus.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.282-20.283"/>But the proud wooers Athena

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>
would in no wise suffer to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.287-20.288"/>There was among the wooers a man with his heart set on lawlessness—Ctesippus was his name, and in Same was his dwelling—who, trusting forsooth in his boundless wealth,

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>
wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.291"/>He it was who now spoke among the haughty wooers:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.292"/>Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.293-20.294"/>A portion has the stranger long had, an equal portion, as is meet; for it is not well nor just to rob of their due

the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.296-20.298"/>Nay, come, I too will give him a stranger's-gift, that he in turn may give a present either to the bath-woman or to some other of the slaves who are in the house of godlike Odysseus.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.299"/>So saying, he hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
taking it up from the basket where it lay. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.300"/>But Odysseus avoided it with a quick turn of his head, and in his heart he smiled a right grim and bitter smile; and the ox's hoof struck the well-built wall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.300-20.302"/>Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.302"/>Ctesippus, verily this thing fell out more to thy soul's profit.

<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.305"/>Thou didst not smite the stranger, for he himself avoided thy missile, else surely would I have struck thee through the middle with my sharp spear, and instead of a wedding feast thy father would have been busied with a funeral feast in this land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.305"/>Wherefore let no man, I warn you, make a show of forwardness in my house; for now I mark and understand all things,

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>
the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.310"/>But none the less we still endure to see these deeds, while sheep are slaughtered, and wine drunk, and bread consumed, for hard it is for one man to restrain many. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.311-20.313"/>Yet come, no longer work me harm of your evil wills.

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.315-20.319"/>But if you are minded even now to slay me myself with the sword, even that would I choose, and it would be better far to die than continually to behold these shameful deeds, strangers mishandled and men dragging the handmaidens in shameful fashion through the fair hall.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.320"/>So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence, but at last there spoke among them Agelaus, son of Damastor:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.321"/>Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.322-20.323"/>Abuse not any more the stranger nor any

of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.326-20.327"/>But to Telemachus and his mother I would speak a gentle word, if perchance it may find favour in the minds of both. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.328-20.332"/>So long as the hearts in your breasts had hope that wise Odysseus would return to his own house,

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>
so long there was no ground for blame that you waited, and restrained the wooers in your halls; for this was the better course, had Odysseus returned and come back to his house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.333"/>But now this is plain, that he will return no more. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.334-20.337"/>Nay then, come, sit by thy mother and tell her this,

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
namely that she must wed him whosoever is the best man, and who offers the most gifts; to the end that thou mayest enjoy in peace all the heritage of thy fathers, eating and drinking, and that she may keep the house of another.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.338"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.339-20.342"/>Nay, by Zeus, Agelaus, and by the woes of my father,

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>
who somewhere far from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> has perished or is wandering, in no wise do I delay my mother's marriage, but I bid her wed what man she will, and I offer besides gifts past counting. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.343-20.344"/>But I am ashamed to drive her forth from the hall against her will by a word of compulsion. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.344"/>May God never bring such a thing to pass.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.345"/>So spoke Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athena roused unquenchable laughter, and turned their wits awry. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.345-20.346"/>And now they laughed with alien lips, and all bedabbled with blood was the flesh they ate,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> and their eyes were filled with tears and their spirits set on wailing.

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.350"/>Then among them spoke godlike Theoclymenus:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.351-20.352"/>Shrouded in night are your heads and your faces and your knees beneath you; kindled is the sound of wailing, bathed in tears are your cheeks, and sprinkled with blood are the walls and the fair rafters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.355-20.356"/>And full of ghosts is the porch and full the court, of ghosts that hasten down to Erebus beneath the darkness, and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist hovers over all.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.356-20.357"/>So he spoke, but they all laughed merrily at him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.358"/>And among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.360"/>Mad is the stranger that has newly come from abroad. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.361-20.362"/>Quick, ye youths, convey him forth out of doors to go his way to the place of assembly, since here he finds it like night.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.363"/>Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.364"/>Eurymachus, in no wise do I bid thee give me guides for my way.

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.365-20.366"/>I have eyes and ears and my two feet, and a mind in my breast that is in no wise meanly fashioned. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.367-20.370"/>With these will I go forth out of doors, for I mark evil coming upon you which not one of the wooers may escape or avoid, of all you who in the house of godlike Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
insult men and devise wicked folly.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.371-20.372"/>So saying, he went forth from the stately halls and came to Piraeus, who received him with a ready heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.373-20.374"/>But all the wooers, looking at one another, sought to provoke Telemachus by laughing at his guests.

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.375"/>And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.376"/>Telemachus, no man is more unlucky in his guests than thou, seeing that thou keepest such a filthy vagabond as this man here, always wanting bread and wine, and skilled neither in the works of peace nor those of war, but a mere burden of the earth.

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.380"/>And this other fellow again stood up to prophesy. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.381"/>Nay, if thou wouldst hearken to me it would be better far: let us fling these strangers on board a benched ship, and send them to the Sicilians, whence they would bring<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> thee in a fitting price.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.382-20.383"/>So spake the wooers, but he paid no heed to their words.

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.387-20.389"/>Nay, in silence he watched his father, ever waiting until he should put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her beautiful chair over against them, and heard the words of each man in the hall.

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.390-20.391"/>For they had made ready their meal in the midst of their laughing, a sweet meal, and one to satisfy the heart, for they had slain many beasts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.392-20.394"/>But never could meal have been more graceless than a supper such as a goddess and a mighty man were soon to set before them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:20.394"/>For unprovoked they were contriving deeds of shame.</p>

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.5-21.7"/>She climbed the high stairway to her chamber, and took the bent key in her strong hand—a goodly key of bronze, and on it was a handle of ivory. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.7"/>And she went her way with her handmaidens to a store-room, far remote, where lay the treasures of her lord,

bronze and gold and iron, wrought with toil. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.11-21.14"/>And there lay the back-bent bow and the quiver that held the arrows, and many arrows were in it, fraught with groanings—gifts which a friend of Odysseus had given him when he met him once in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, even Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals.

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.20-21.21"/>It was on an embassy in quest of these that Odysseus had come a far journey, while he was but a youth; for his father and the other elders had sent him forth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.21"/>And Iphitus, on his part, had come in search of twelve brood mares, which he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat; but to him thereafter did they bring death and doom,

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
when he came to the stout-hearted son of Zeus, the man Heracles, who well knew<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> deeds of daring; for Heracles slew him, his guest though he was, in his own house, ruthlessly, and had regard neither for the wrath of the gods nor for the table which he had set before him, but slew the man thereafter,

and himself kept the stout-hoofed mares in his halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.31-21.33"/>It was while asking for these that Iphitus met Odysseus, and gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus had been wont to bear, and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.34-21.35"/>And to Iphitus Odysseus gave a sharp sword and a mighty spear,

as the beginning of loving friendship; yet they never knew one another at the table, for ere that might be the son of Zeus had slain Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals, who gave Odysseus the bow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.35-21.36"/>This bow goodly Odysseus, when going forth to war, would never

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.98-21.100"/>So he spoke, but the heart in his breast hoped that he would string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Yet verily he was to be the first to taste of an arrow from the hands of noble Odysseus, whom then he,

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
as he sat in the halls, was dishonoring, and urging on all his comrades.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.101"/>Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.102"/>Lo now, of a truth Zeus, son of Cronos, has made me witless. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.103-21.104"/>My dear mother, for all that she is wise, declares that she will follow another lord, forsaking this house;

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
yet I laugh, and am glad with a witless mind. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.105"/>Come then, ye wooers, since this is shewn to be your prize, a lady, the like of whom is not now in the Achaean land, neither in sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, nor in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, nor in Mycene, nor yet in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, nor in the dark mainland.

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>
 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Nay, but of yourselves you know this—what need have I to praise my mother? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Come then, put not the matter aside with excuses, nor any more turn away too long from the drawing of the bow, that we may see the issue. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Yea, and I would myself make trial of yon bow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>If I shall string it and shoot an arrow through the iron,

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
it will not vex me that my honored mother should leave this house and go along with another, seeing that I should be left here able now to wield the goodly battle-gear of my father.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.118-21.119"/>With this he flung the scarlet cloak from off his back, and sprang up erect; and he laid his sharp sword from off his shoulders.

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.120-21.122"/>First then he set up the axes, when he had dug a trench, one long trench for all, and made it straight to the line, and about them he stamped in the earth. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.122-21.123"/>And amazement seized all who saw him, that he set them out so orderly, though before he had never seen them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.123"/>Then he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow.

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.125-21.127"/>Thrice he made it quiver in his eagerness to draw it, and thrice he relaxed his effort, though in his heart he hoped to string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.128-21.129"/>And now at the last he would haply have strung it in his might, as for the fourth time he sought to draw up the string, but Odysseus nodded in dissent, and checked him in his eagerness.

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.130"/>Then the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them again:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.131-21.133"/>Out on it, even in days to come shall I be a coward and a weakling, or else I am too young, and have not yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.134-21.135"/>But, come now, you that are mightier than I,

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
make trial of the bow, and let us end the contest.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.136-21.139"/>So saying, he set the bow from him on the ground, leaning it against the jointed, polished door, and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down again on the seat from which he had risen.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.140"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.141-21.142"/>Rise up in order, all you of our company, from left to right, beginning from the place where the cupbearer pours the wine.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.143"/>So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.144-21.146"/>Then first arose Leiodes, son of Oenops,

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
who was their soothsayer, and ever sat by the fair mixing-bowl in the innermost part of the hall; deeds of wanton folly were hateful to him alone, and he was full of indignation at all the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.146-21.147"/>He it was who now first took the bow and swift arrow, and he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow;

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>
but he could not string it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.150-21.151"/>Ere that might be his hands grew weary, as he sought to draw up the string, his unworn delicate hands; and he spoke among the wooers:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.151"/>Friends, it is not I that shall string it; let another take it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.152"/>For many princes shall this bow rob of spirit and of life, since verily it is better far

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
to die than to live on and fail of that for the sake of which we ever gather here, waiting expectantly day after day. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.157-21.158"/>Now many a man even hopes in his heart and desires to wed Penelope, the wife of Odysseus; but when he shall have made trial of the bow, and seen the outcome, thereafter let him woo

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
some other of the fair-robed Achaean women with his gifts, and seek to win her; then should Penelope wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.</q></p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:21.163-21.204">
                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.161-21.162"/>So he spoke, and set the bow from him, leaning it against the jointed, polished door,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down on the seat from which he had risen. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.167"/>But Antinous rebuked him, and spoke, and addressed him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.168-21.171"/>Leiodes, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, a dread word and grievous! I am angered to hear it,

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>
if forsooth this bow is to rob princes of spirit and of life, because thou art not able to string it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.172-21.173"/>For, I tell thee, thy honored mother did not bear thee of such strength as to draw a bow and shoot arrows; but others of the lordly wooers will soon string it.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.175"/>So he spoke, and called to Melanthius, the goatherd: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.176-21.180"/>Come now, light a fire in the hall, Melanthius; and set by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and bring forth a great cake of the fat that is within, that we youths may warm the bow, and anoint it with fat,

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>
and so make trial of it, and end the contest.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.181-21.183"/>So he spoke, and Melanthius straightway rekindled the unwearied fire, and brought and placed by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and he brought forth a great cake of the fat that was within. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.184"/>Therewith the youths warmed the bow, and made trial of it, but they could not

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
string it, for they were far lacking in strength.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.186-21.187"/>Now Antinous was still persisting and godlike Eurymachus, leaders of the wooers, who were far the best in valiance; but those other two had gone forth both together from the hall, the neatherd and the swineherd of divine Odysseus;

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
and after them Odysseus himself went forth from the house. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.190"/>But when they were now outside the gates and the court, he spoke and addressed them with gentle words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.191-21.192"/>Neatherd, and thou too swineherd, shall I tell you something or keep it to myself? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.193-21.194"/>Nay, my spirit bids me tell it.

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.195-21.196"/>What manner of men would you be to defend Odysseus, if he should come from somewhere thus suddenly, and some god should bring him? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.197"/>Would you bear aid to the wooers or to Odysseus? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.198"/>Speak out as your heart and spirit bid you.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.199"/>Then the herdsmen of the cattle answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.200-21.201"/>Father Zeus, oh that thou wouldest fulfil this wish! Grant that that man may come back, and that some god may guide him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.202"/>Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.203-21.204"/>And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus; might come back to his own home.</p>

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.205-21.206"/>But when he knew with certainty the mind of these, he made answer, and spoke to them again, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.207-21.208"/>At home now in truth am I here before you, my very self. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.209-21.210"/>After many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And I know that by you two

alone of all my thralls is my coming desired, but of the rest have I heard not one praying that I might come back again to my home. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.210-21.211"/>But to you two will I tell the truth, even as it shall be. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.212"/>If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will bring you each a wife, and will give you possessions

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
and a house built near my own, and thereafter you two shall be in my eyes friends and brothers of Telemachus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.215-21.216"/>Nay, come, more than this, I will shew you also a manifest sign, that you may know me well and be assured in heart, even the scar of the wound which long ago a boar dealt me with his white tusk,

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>
when I went to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> with the sons of Autolycus.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.221"/>So saying, he drew aside the rags from the great scar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.222-21.225"/>And when the two had seen it, and had marked each thing well, they flung their arms about wise Odysseus, and wept; and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.226-21.227"/>And even in like manner Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.228-21.229"/>And now the light of the sun would have gone down upon their weeping, had not Odysseus himself checked them, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Cease now from weeping and wailing, lest some one come forth from the hall and see us, and make it known within as well.

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.230-21.231"/>But go within one after another, not all together, I first and you thereafter, and let this be made a sign. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.231"/>All the rest, as many as are lordly wooers, will not suffer the bow and the quiver to be given to me; but do thou, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through the halls,

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>
place it in my hands, and bid the women bar the close-fitting doors of their hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>And if any one of them hears groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.240-21.241"/>But to thee, goodly Philoetius, do I give charge to fasten with a bar the gate of the court, and swiftly to cast a cord upon it.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.242"/>So saying, he entered the stately house, and went and sat down on the seat from which he had risen. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.243"/>And the two slaves of divine Odysseus went in as well.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.245-21.246"/>Eurymachus was now handling the bow, warming it on this side and on that in the light of the fire; but not even so was he able to string it; and in his noble heart he groaned, and with a burst of anger he spoke and addressed them: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.246-21.247"/>Out on it! Verily I am grieved for myself and for you all.

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.250"/>It is in no wise for the marriage that I mourn so greatly, grieved though I am; for there are many other Achaean women, some in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, and some in other cities; but I mourn if in truth we fall so far short of godlike Odysseus in might, seeing that we cannot string

his bow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.256"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.257"/>Eurymachus, this shall not be so, and thou of thyself too knowest it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.257"/>For to-day throughout the land is the feast of the god<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note>—a holy feast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.258-21.259"/>Who then would bend a bow? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.259"/>Nay, quietly

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>
set it by; and as for the axes—what if we should let them all stand as they are? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.260-21.261"/>No man, methinks, will come to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and carry them off. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.261-21.262"/>Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation into the cups, that we may pour libations, and lay aside the curved bow.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.265-21.268"/>And in the morning bid Melanthius, the goatherd, to bring she-goats, far the best in all the herds, that we may lay thigh-pieces on the altar of Apollo, the famed archer; and so make trial of the bow, and end the contest.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.269"/>So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them.

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.270-21.272"/>Then the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.273-21.274"/>But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.275"/>Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.276"/>To Eurymachus most of all do I make my prayer, and to godlike Antinous, since this word also of his was spoken aright, namely that for the present you cease to try the bow, and leave the issue with the gods;

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
and in the morning the god will give the victory to whomsoever he will. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.280"/>But come, give me the polished bow, that in your midst I may prove my hands and strength, whether I have yet might such as was of old in my supple limbs, or whether by now my wanderings and lack of food have destroyed it.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>

that thou feastest undisturbed in our proud company, and lackest naught of the banquet, but hearest our words and our speech, while no other that is a stranger and beggar hears our words? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.291-21.292"/>It is wine that wounds thee, honey-sweet wine, which works harm to others too, if one takes it in great gulps, and drinks beyond measure.

<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.295-21.297"/>It was wine that made foolish even the centaur, glorious Eurytion, in the hall of greathearted Peirithous, when he went to the Lapithae: and when his heart had been made foolish with wine, in his madness he wrought evil in the house of Peirithous. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.297-21.298"/>Then grief seized the heroes,

<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>
and they leapt up and dragged him forth through the gateway, when they had shorn off his ears and his nostrils with the pitiless bronze, and he, made foolish in heart, went his way, bearing with him the curse of his sin in the folly of his heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.301-21.302"/>From hence the feud arose between the centaurs and mankind; but it was for himself first that he found evil, being heavy with wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.305-21.306"/>Even so do I declare great harm for thee, if thou shalt string the bow, for thou shalt meet with no kindness at the hands of anyone in our land, but we will send thee straightway in a black ship to king Echetus, the maimer of all men, from whose hands thou shalt in no wise escape alive. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.306-21.309"/>Nay, then, be still,

‘Truly men weaker far are wooing the wife of a noble man, and cannot string his polished bow.

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.330"/>Then wise Penelope answered him again: <q>

and will give him a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and a two-edged sword; and I will give him sandals to bind beneath his feet, and will send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.341-21.342"/>Then wise Telemachus answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.353"/>She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber,

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.355"/>Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.356-21.358"/>Now the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow and was bearing it,

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>
but the wooers all cried out in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.360"/>And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.361"/>Whither, pray, art thou bearing the curved bow, miserable swineherd, thou man distraught? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.362-21.363"/>Soon by thy swine, alone and apart from men, shall the swift hounds devour thee—hounds thyself didst rear—if but Apollo

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.366-21.367"/>So they spoke, and he set down the bow, as he bore it, in that very place, seized with fear because many men were crying out aloud in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.368"/>But Telemachus on the other side called out threateningly:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.369"/>Father, bear the bow onward—soon shalt thou rue giving heed to all—

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>
lest, younger though I am, I drive thee to the field, and pelt thee with stones; for in strength I am the better. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.371"/>I would that I were even so much better in strength and might than all the wooers that are in the house; then would I soon send many a one

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>
forth from our house to go his way in evil case; for they devise wickedness.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.376-21.378"/>So he spoke, but all the wooers laughed merrily at him, and relaxed the bitterness of their anger against Telemachus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.378-21.379"/>Howbeit the swineherd bore the bow through the hall, and came up to wise Odysseus, and put it in his hands.

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.380"/>Then he called forth the nurse Eurycleia, and said to her:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.381-21.382"/>Telemachus bids thee, wise Eurycleia, to bar the close-fitting doors of the hall, and if any of the women hear within groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not

rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.386-21.387"/>So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; and she barred the doors of the stately halls. 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.388-21.389"/>But in silence Philoetius hastened forth from the house, and barred the gates of the well-fenced court.

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.390-21.391"/>Now there lay beneath the portico the cable of a curved ship, made of byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and then himself went within. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.392-21.393"/>Thereafter he came and sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus; now he was already handling the bow, turning it round and round, and trying it this way and that,

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
lest worms might have eaten the horns, while its lord was afar. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.396"/>And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.397"/>Verily he has a shrewd eye, and is a cunning knave with a bow. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.398-21.400"/>It may be haply that he has himself such bows stored away at home, or else he is minded to make one, that he thus

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.401"/>And again another of the proud youths would say: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.402-21.403"/>Would that the fellow might find profit in just such measure as he shall prove able ever to string this bow.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.404"/>So spoke the wooers, but Odysseus of many wiles,

<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>
as soon as he had lifted the great bow and scanned it on every side—even as when a man well-skilled in the lyre and in song easily stretches the string about a new peg, making fast at either end the twisted sheep-gut—so without effort did Odysseus string the great bow.

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.410"/>And he held it in his right hand, and tried the string, which sang sweetly beneath his touch, like to a swallow in tone. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.411"/>But upon the wooers came great grief, and the faces of them changed color, and Zeus thundered loud, shewing forth his signs. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.412-21.413"/>Then glad at heart was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
that the son of crooked-counselling Cronos sent him an omen, and he took up a swift arrow, which lay by him on the table, bare, but the others were stored within the hollow quiver, even those of which the Achaeans were soon to taste. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.415"/>This he took, and laid upon the bridge of the bow, and drew the bow-string and the notched arrow

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
even from the chair where he sat, and let fly the shaft with sure aim, and did not miss the end of the handle of one of the axes, but clean through and out at the end passed the arrow weighted with bronze. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.423"/>But he spoke to Telemachus, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.424-21.426"/>Telemachus, the stranger

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>
that sits in thy halls brings no shame upon thee, nor in any wise did I miss the mark, or labour long in stringing the bow; still is my strength unbroken—not as the wooers scornfully taunt me. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.426-21.427"/>But now it is time that supper too be made ready for the Achaeans, while yet there is light, and thereafter must yet other sport be made

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>
with song and with the lyre; for these things are the accompaniments of a feast.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:21.430"/>He spoke, and made a sign with his brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, girt about him his sharp sword, and took his spear in his grasp, and stood by the chair at his father's side, armed with gleaming bronze.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But Odysseus of many wiles stripped off his rags and sprang to the great threshold with the bow and the quiver full of arrows, and poured forth the swift arrows right there before his feet, and spoke among the wooers:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.5"/>Lo, now at last is this decisive contest ended; and now as for another mark, which till now no man has ever smitten, I will know<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> if haply I may strike it, and Apollo grant me glory.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.6-22.7"/>He spoke, and aimed a bitter arrow at Antinous. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.8"/>Now he was on the point of raising to his lips a fair goblet,

<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>
a two-eared cup of gold, and was even now handling it, that he might drink of the wine, and death was not in his thoughts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.11-22.12"/>For who among men that sat at meat could think that one man among many, how strong soever he were, would bring upon himself evil death and black fate?

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.15-22.16"/>But Odysseus took aim, and smote him with an arrow in the throat, and clean out through the tender neck passed the point; he sank to one side, and the cup fell from his hand as he was smitten, and straightway up through his nostrils there came a thick jet of the blood of man; and quickly

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>
he thrust the table from him with a kick of his foot, and spilled all the food on the floor, and the bread and roast flesh were befouled. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.21"/>Then into uproar broke the wooers through the halls, as they saw the man fallen, and from their high seats they sprang, driven in fear through the hall, gazing everywhere along the well-built walls;

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>
but nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to seize. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.25"/>But they railed at Odysseus with angry words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.26"/>Stranger, to thy cost dost thou shoot at men; never again shalt thou take part in other contests; now is thy utter destruction sure. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.27"/>Aye, for thou hast now slain a man who was far the best

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.31-22.32"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered them:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.35-22.40"/>Ye dogs, ye thought that I should never more come home from the land of the Trojans, seeing that ye wasted my house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and while yet I lived covertly wooed my wife, having no fear of the gods, who hold broad heaven,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.42"/>So he spoke, and thereat<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">2</note> pale fear seized them all, and each man gazed about to see how he might escape utter destruction; Eurymachus alone answered him, and said:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.45-22.47"/>If thou art indeed Odysseus of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, come home again, this that thou sayest is just regarding all that the Achaeans have wrought—many deeds of wanton folly in thy halls and many in the field. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.48-22.49"/>But he now lies dead, who was to blame for all, even Antinous; for it was he who set on foot these deeds,

<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>
not so much through desire or need of the marriage, but with another purpose, which the son of Cronos did not bring to pass for him, that in the land of settled <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> he might himself be king, and might lie in wait for thy son and slay him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.54-22.55"/>But now he lies slain, as was his due, but do thou spare the people

that are thine own; and we will hereafter go about the land and get thee recompense for all that has been drunk and eaten in thy halls, and will bring each man for himself in requital the worth of twenty oxen, and pay thee back in bronze and gold until thy heart be warmed; but till then no one could blame thee that thou art wroth.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.60"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.61-22.64"/>Eurymachus, not even if you should give me in requital all that your fathers left you, even all that you now have, and should add other wealth thereto from whence ye might, not even so would I henceforth stay my hands from slaying until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgression.

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.65-22.66"/>Now it lies before you to fight in open fight, or to flee, if any man may avoid death and the fates; but many a one, methinks, shall not escape from utter destruction.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.67"/>So he spoke, and their knees were loosened where they stood, and their hearts melted; and Eurymachus spoke among them again a second time:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.70-22.73"/>Friends, for you see that this man will not stay his invincible hands, but now that he was got the polished bow and the quiver, will shoot from the smooth threshold until he slays us all, come, let us take thought of battle. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.73"/>Draw your swords, and hold the tables before you against

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>
the arrows that bring swift death, and let us all have at him in a body, in the hope that we may thrust him from the threshold and the doorway, and go throughout the city, and so the alarm be swiftly raised; then should this fellow soon have shot his last.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.75-22.77"/>So saying, he drew his sharp sword

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>
of bronze, two-edged, and sprang upon Odysseus with a terrible cry, but at the same instant goodly Odysseus let fly an arrow, and struck him upon the breast beside the nipple, and fixed the swift shaft in his liver. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.81-22.83"/>And Eurymachus let the sword fall from his hand to the ground, and writhing over the table

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>
he bowed and fell, and spilt upon the floor the food and the two-handled cup. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.86-22.88"/>With his brow he beat the earth in agony of soul, and with both his feet he spurned and shook the chair, and a mist was shed over his eyes.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.88"/>Then Amphinomus made at glorious Odysseus,

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
rushing straight upon him, and had drawn his sharp sword, in hope that Odysseus might give way before him from the door. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.91-22.93"/>But Telemachus was too quick for him, and cast, and smote him from behind with his bronze-tipped spear between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast; and he fell with a thud, and struck the ground full with his forehead.

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.95-22.96"/>But Telemachus sprang back, leaving the long spear where it was, fixed in Amphinomus, for he greatly feared lest, as he sought to draw forth the long spear, one of the Achaeans might rush upon him and stab with his sword, or deal him a blow as he stooped over the corpse. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.96-22.98"/>So he started to run, and came quickly to his dear father,

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>
and standing by his side spoke to him winged words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.101-22.104"/>Father, now will I bring thee a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, well fitted to the temples, and when I come back I will arm myself, and will give armour likewise to the swineherd and yon neatherd; for it is better to be clothed in armour.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.105"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.108-22.109"/>So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and went his way to the store-chamber where the glorious arms were stored.

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.110-22.111"/>Thence he took four shields and eight spears and four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse-hair; and he bore them forth, and quickly came to his dear father. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.112-22.113"/>Then first of all he himself girded the bronze about his body, and even in like manner the two slaves put on them the beautiful armour,

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>
and took their stand on either side of Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.116"/>But he, so long as he had arrows to defend him, would ever aim, and smite the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell thick and fast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.117-22.118"/>But when the arrows failed the prince, as he shot,

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
he leaned the bow against the door-post of the well-built hall, and let it stand against the bright entrance wall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>For himself, he put about his shoulders a four-fold shield, and set on his mighty head a well-wrought helmet with horse-hair plume, and terribly did the plume wave above him;

and he took two mighty spears, tipped with bronze.</p>

and as many helmets of bronze with thick plumes of horsehair, and went his way, and quickly brought and gave them to the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.146"/>Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, when he saw them donning armour and brandishing long spears in their hands, and great did his task seem to him;

but quickly he spoke to Telemachus winged words:

then make fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoist him up the tall pillar, till you bring him near the roof-beams, that he may keep alive long, and suffer grievous torment.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.178-22.179"/>So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Forth they went to the store-room, unseen of him who was within.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.180-22.181"/>He truly was seeking for armour in the innermost part of the store-room, and the two lay in wait, standing on either side of the door-posts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.182-22.185"/>And when Melanthius, the goatherd, was about to pass over the threshold, bearing in one hand a goodly helm, and in the other a broad old shield, flecked with rust—

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
the shield of lord Laertes, which he was wont to bear in his youth, but now it was laid by, and the seams of its straps were loosened—then the two sprang upon him and seized him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.186"/>They dragged him in by the hair, and flung him down on the ground in sore terror, and bound his feet and hands with galling bonds,

<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>
binding them firmly behind his back, as the son of Laertes bade them, the much enduring, goodly Odysseus; and they made fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoisted him up the tall pillar, till they brought him near the roof-beams. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.192-22.193"/>Then didst thou mock him, swineherd Eumaeus, and say:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.195-22.196"/>Now verily, Melanthius, shalt thou watch the whole night through, lying on a soft bed, as befits thee, nor shalt thou fail to mark the early Dawn, golden-throned, as she comes forth from the streams of Oceanus, at the hour when thou art wont to drive thy she-goats for the wooers, to prepare a feast in the halls.</q> 
    

<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.200"/>So he was left there, stretched in the direful bond, but the two put on their armour, and closed the bright door, and went to Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.201-22.202"/>There they stood, breathing fury, those on the threshold but four, while those within the hall were many and brave.

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.205-22.206"/>Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them, like unto Mentor in form and voice, and Odysseus saw her, and was glad; and he spoke, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.207"/>Mentor, ward off ruin, and remember me, thy dear comrade, who often befriended thee.

<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.210"/>So he spoke, deeming that it was Athena, the rouser of hosts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.211"/>But the wooers on the other side shouted aloud in the hall, and first Agelaus, son of Damastor, rebuked Athena, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.212"/>Mentor, let not Odysseus beguile thee with his words to fight against the wooers and bear aid to himself.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.215"/>For in this wise, methinks, shall our will be brought to pass: when we have killed these men, father and son, thereafter shalt thou too be slain with them, such deeds art thou minded to do in these halls: with thine own head shalt thou pay the price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.221-22.223"/>So he spoke, and Athena waxed the more wroth at heart,

<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>
and she rebuked Odysseus with angry words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.226-22.230"/>Odysseus, no longer hast thou steadfast might nor any valor, such as was thine when for high-born Helen of the white arms thou didst for nine years battle with the Trojans unceasingly, and many men thou slewest in dread conflict,

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
and by thy counsel was the broad-wayed city of Priam taken. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.231-22.232"/>How is it that now, when thou hast come to thy house and thine own possessions, thou shrinkest with wailing from playing the man, and that against the wooers? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.233-22.235"/>Nay, friend, come hither and take thy stand by my side, and see my deeds, that thou mayest know what manner of man

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.236-22.238"/>Mentor, son of Alcimus, is to repay kindness in the midst of the foe.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.239-22.240"/>She spoke, but did not give him strength utterly to turn the course of the battle, but still made trial of the might and valor of Odysseus and his glorious son; and for herself,

<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>
she flew up to the roof-beam of the smoky hall, and sat there in the guise of a swallow to look upon.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.241-22.243"/>Now the wooers were urged on by Agelaus, son of Damastor, by Eurynomus, and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and Peisander, son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these were in valiance far the best of all the wooers

<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>
who still lived and fought for their lives; but the rest the bow and the swiftly-falling arrows had by now laid low. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.246"/>But Agelaus spoke among them, and declared his word to all:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.247"/>Friends, now at length will this man stay his invincible hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.248"/>Lo, Mentor has gone from him, and has but uttered empty boasts,

<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>
and they are left alone there at the outer doors. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.251-22.253"/>Therefore hurl not now upon them your long spears all at once, but come, do you six throw first in the hope that Zeus may grant that Odysseus be struck, and that we win glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.255-22.256"/>So he spoke, and they all hurled their spears, as he bade, eagerly; but Athena made all vain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.256-22.258"/>One man smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall.

<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.260-22.261"/>But when they had avoided the spears of the wooers, first among them spoke the much-enduring goodly Odysseus:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.262-22.264"/>Friends, now I give the word that we too cast our spears into the throng of the wooers, who are minded to slay us in addition to their former wrongs.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.265-22.266"/>So he spoke, and they all hurled their sharp spears with sure aim. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.266-22.268"/>Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, the swineherd Elatus, and the herdsmen of the cattle slew Peisander. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.269-22.270"/>So these all at the same moment bit the vast floor with their teeth,

<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>
and the wooers drew back to the innermost part of the hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.271"/>But the others sprang forward and drew forth their spears from the dead bodies.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.272-22.273"/>Then again the wooers hurled their sharp spears eagerly, but Athena made them vain, many as they were. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.273"/>One man

<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>
smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.276"/>But Amphimedon smote Telemachus on the hand by the wrist, a grazing blow, and the bronze tore the surface of the skin. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.277-22.278"/>And Ctesippus with his long spear

<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>
grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus above his shield, but the spear flew over and fell upon the ground. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.280"/>Then once more Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and his company hurled their sharp spears into the throng of the wooers, and again Odysseus, the sacker of cities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, the swineherd Polybus,

<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>
and thereafter the herdsman of the cattle smote Ctesippus in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.285-22.286"/>Son of Polytherses, thou lover of revilings, never more at all do thou speak big, yielding to folly, but leave the matter to the gods, since verily they are mightier far.

<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.290-22.291"/>This is thy gift of welcome to match the hoof which of late thou gavest to godlike Odysseus, when he went begging through the house.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.292"/>So spoke the herdsman of the sleek cattle. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.292-22.293"/>But Odysseus wounded the son of Damastor in close fight with a thrust of his long spear, and Telemachus wounded Leiocritus, son of Evenor,

with a spear-thrust full upon the groin, and drove the bronze clean through, and he fell headlong and struck the ground full with his forehead. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.296"/>Then Athena held up her aegis, the bane of mortals, on high from the roof, and the minds of the wooers were panic-stricken, and they fled through the halls like a herd of kine

that the darting gad-fly falls upon and drives along in the season of spring, when the long days come.

and the vultures pounce upon them and slay them, and they have no defence or way of escape, and men rejoice at the chase; even so did those others set upon the wooers and smite them left and right through the hall. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.306"/>And therefrom rose hideous groaning as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.310-22.311"/>But Leiodes rushed forward and clasped the knees of Odysseus, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.312"/>By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.312"/>For I declare to thee that never yet have I wronged one of the women in thy halls by wanton word or deed; nay,

<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.316"/>I sought to check the other wooers, when any would do such deeds. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.317"/>But they would not hearken to me to withhold their hands from evil, wherefore through their wanton folly they have met a cruel doom. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.318-22.319"/>Yet I, the soothsayer among them, that have done no wrong, shall be laid low even as they; so true is it that there is no gratitude in aftertime for good deeds done.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.320"/>Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.321-22.324"/>If verily thou dost declare thyself the soothsayer among these men, often, I ween, must thou have prayed in the halls that far from me the issue of a joyous return might be removed, and that it might be with thee that my dear wife should go and bear thee children;

<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>
wherefore thou shalt not escape grievous death.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.325"/>So saying, he seized in his strong hand a sword that lay near, which Agelaus had let fall to the ground when he was slain, and with this he smote him full upon the neck. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.326-22.328"/>And even while he was yet speaking his head was mingled with the dust.</p>

<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.330-22.331"/>Now the son of Terpes, the minstrel, was still seeking to escape black fate, even Phemius, who sang perforce among the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.332-22.333"/>He stood with the clear-toned lyre in his hands near the postern door, and he was divided in mind whether he should slip out from the hall

<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>
and sit down by the well-built altar of great Zeus, the God of the court, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burned many things of oxen, or whether he should rush forward and clasp the knees of Odysseus in prayer. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.338-22.339"/>And as he pondered this seemed to him the better course, to clasp the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes.

<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.340-22.343"/>So he laid the hollow lyre on the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded chair, and himself rushed forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.344"/>By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity;

<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>
on thine own self shall sorrow come hereafter, if thou slayest the minstrel, even me, who sing to gods and men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.345-22.346"/>Self-taught am I, and the god has planted in my heart all manner of lays, and worthy am I to sing to thee as to a god; wherefore be not eager to cut my throat.

<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.350-22.353"/>Aye, and Telemachus too will bear witness to this, thy dear son, how that through no will or desire of mine I was wont to resort to thy house to sing to the wooers at their feasts, but they, being far more and stronger, led me hither perforce.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.354-22.355"/>So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus heard him,

<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>
and quickly spoke to his father, who was near:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.356"/>Stay thy hand, and do not wound this guiltless man with the sword. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.357-22.360"/>Aye, and let us save also the herald, Medon, who ever cared for me in our house, when I was a child—unless perchance Philoetius has already slain him, or the swineherd,

<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>
or he met thee as thou didst rage through the house.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.361"/>So he spoke, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him, for he lay crouching beneath a chair, and had clothed himself in the skin of an ox, newly flayed, seeking to avoid black fate. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.362-22.363"/>Straightway he rose from beneath the chair and stripped off the ox-hide,

<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>
and then rushed forward and clasped Telemachus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: 
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.367-22.370"/>Friend, here I am; stay thou thy hand and bid thy father stay his, lest in the greatness of his might he harm me with the sharp bronze in his wrath against the wooers, who wasted his

possessions in the halls, and in their folly honored thee not at all.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.371"/>But Odysseus of many wiles smiled, and said to him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.372-22.374"/>Be of good cheer, for he has delivered thee and saved thee, that thou mayest know in thy heart and tell also to another, how far better is the doing of good deeds than of evil.

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.375-22.377"/>But go forth from the halls and sit down outside in the court away from the slaughter, thou and the minstrel of many songs, till I shall have finished all that I must needs do in the house.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.378-22.380"/>So he spoke, and the two went their way forth from the hall and sat down by the altar of great Zeus,

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
gazing about on every side, ever expecting death. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.381-22.382"/>And Odysseus too gazed about all through his house to see if any man yet lived, and was hiding there, seeking to avoid black fate. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.383-22.386"/>But he found them one and all fallen in the blood and dust—all the host of them, like fishes that fishermen

have drawn forth in the meshes of their net from the grey sea upon the curving beach, and they all lie heaped upon the sand, longing for the waves of the sea, and the bright sun takes away their life; even so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.390"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles spoke to Telemachus:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.393-22.394"/>So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and shaking the door said to Eurycleia:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.395-22.396"/>Up and hither, aged wife, that hast charge of all our woman servants in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.397"/>Come, my father calls thee, that he may tell thee somewhat.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.397"/>So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; she opened the doors of the stately hall,

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
and came forth, and Telemachus led the way before her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.400"/>There she found Odysseus amid the bodies of the slain, all befouled with blood and filth, like a lion that comes from feeding on an ox of the farmstead, and all his breast and his cheeks on either side

are stained with blood, and he is terrible to look upon; even so was Odysseus befouled, his feet and his hands above. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.406"/>But she, when she beheld the corpses and the great welter of blood, made ready to utter loud cries of joy, seeing what a deed had been wrought. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.407-22.408"/>But Odysseus stayed and checked her in her eagerness,

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
and spoke and addressed her with winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.411"/>In thine own heart rejoice, old dame, but refrain thyself and cry not out aloud: an unholy thing is it to boast over slain men. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.412"/>These men here has the fate of the gods destroyed and their own reckless deeds, for they honored no one of men upon the earth,

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>
were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; wherefore by their wanton folly they brought on themselves a shameful death. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.416"/>But come, name thou over to me the women in the halls, which ones dishonor me and which are guiltless.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.417-22.418"/>Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him:

<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.420"/>Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth.

and regard not me nor Penelope herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.440-22.445"/>But when you have set all the house in order, lead the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> and the goodly fence of the court, and there strike them down with your long swords, until you take away the life from them all, and they forget the love

which they had at the bidding of the wooers, when they lay with them in secret.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.446-22.447"/>So he spoke, and the women came all in a throng, wailing terribly and shedding big tears. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.448-22.450"/>First they bore forth the bodies of the slain and set them down beneath the portico of the well-fenced court,

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>
propping them one against the other; and Odysseus himself gave them orders and hastened on the work, and they bore the bodies forth perforce. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.450-22.451"/>Then they cleansed the beautiful high seats and the tables with water and porous sponges. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.451"/>But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd

scraped with hoes the floor of the well-built house, and the women bore the scrapings forth and threw them out of doors. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.456"/>But when they had set in order all the hall, they led the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome and the goodly fence of the court,

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
and shut them up in a narrow space, whence it was in no wise possible to escape. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.461"/>Then wise Telemachus was the first to speak to the others, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.462-22.464"/>Let it be by no clean death that I take the lives of these women, who on my own head have poured reproaches and on my mother, and were wont to lie with the wooers.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.465-22.467"/>So he spoke, and tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great pillar and flung it round the dome, stretching it on high that none might reach the ground with her feet. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.468-22.472"/>And as when long-winged thrushes or doves fall into a snare that is set in a thicket,

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>
as they seek to reach their resting-place, and hateful is the bed that gives them welcome, even so the women held their heads in a row, and round the necks of all nooses were laid, that they might die most piteously. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.473"/>And they writhed a little while with their feet, but not long.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.474"/>Then forth they led Melanthius through the doorway and the court,

and cut off his nostrils and his ears with the pitiless bronze, and drew out his vitals for the dogs to eat raw, and cut off his hands and his feet in their furious wrath.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.475-22.477"/>Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into the house to Odysseus, and the work was done.

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.480"/>But Odysseus said to the dear nurse Eurycleia: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.481-22.482"/>Bring sulphur, old dame, to cleanse from pollution, and bring me fire, that I may purge the hall; and do thou bid Penelope come hither with her handmaidens, and order all the women in the house to come.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.490"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.492-22.493"/>So he spoke, and the dear nurse Eurycleia did not disobey, but brought fire and sulphur; but Odysseus throughly purged the hall and the house and the court.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.495-22.496"/>Then the old dame went back through the fair house of Odysseus to bear tidings to the women and bid them come; and they came forth from their hall with torches in their hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:22.497"/>They thronged about Odysseus and embraced him, and clasped and kissed his head and shoulders

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.10"/>Then wise Penelope answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.11-23.13"/>Dear nurse, the gods have made thee mad, they who can make foolish even one who is full wise, and set the simple-minded in the paths of understanding; it is they that have marred thy wits, though heretofore thou wast sound of mind.

<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.15-23.17"/>Why dost thou mock me, who have a heart full of sorrow, to tell me this wild tale, and dost rouse me out of slumber, the sweet slumber that bound me and enfolded my eyelids? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.18-23.19"/>For never yet have I slept so sound since the day when Odysseus went forth to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> that should not be named.

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.20"/>Nay come now, go down and back to the women's hall, for if any other of the women that are mine had come and told me this, and had roused me out of sleep, straightway would I have sent her back in sorry wise to return again to the hall, but to thee old age shall bring this profit.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.25"/>Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.26-23.28"/>I mock thee not, dear child, but in very truth Odysseus is here, and has come home, even as I tell thee. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.29-23.31"/>He is that stranger to whom all men did dishonor in the halls. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But Telemachus long ago knew that he was here,

yet in his prudence he hid the purpose of his father, till he should take vengeance on the violence of overweening men.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.32-23.33"/>So she spoke, and Penelope was glad, and she leapt from her bed and flung her arms about the old woman and let the tears fall from her eyelids; and she spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.35-23.38"/>Come now, dear nurse, I pray thee tell me truly, if verily he has come home, as thou sayest, how he put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers, all alone as he was, while they remained always in a body in the house.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.39"/>Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:

<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.40-23.41"/>I saw not, I asked not; only I heard the groaning of men that were being slain. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.41-23.44"/>As for us women, we sat terror-stricken in the innermost part of our well-built chambers, and the close-fitting doors shut us in, until the hour when thy son Telemachus called me from the hall, for his father had sent him forth to call me.

<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>

but he is purging the fair house with sulphur, and has kindled a great fire, and sent me forth to call thee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.52-23.53"/>But now at length has this thy long desire been fulfilled:

<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>
he has come himself, alive to his own hearth, and he has found both thee and his son in the halls; while as for those, even the wooers, who wrought him evil, on them has he taken vengeance one and all in his house.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.55-23.56"/>Then wise Penelope answered her: <q>

<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.60-23.61"/>Thou knowest how welcome the sight of him in the halls would be to all, but above all to me and to his son, born of us two. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.62-23.64"/>But this is no true tale, as thou tellest it; nay, some one of the immortals has slain the lordly wooers in wrath at their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.

<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.65-23.66"/>For they honored no one among men upon the earth, were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; therefore it is through their own wanton folly that they have suffered evil. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.67"/>But Odysseus far away has lost his return to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>, and is lost himself.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.67-23.68"/>Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:

<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.70-23.72"/>My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, in that thou saidst that thy husband, who even now is here, at his own hearth, would never more return! Thy heart is ever unbelieving. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.72"/>Nay come, I will tell thee a manifest sign besides, even the scar of the wound which long ago the boar dealt him with his white tusk.

<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.75-23.76"/>This I marked while I washed his feet, and was fain to tell it to thee as well, but he laid his hand upon my mouth, and in the great wisdom of his heart would not suffer me to speak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.76-23.77"/>So come with me; but I will set my very life at stake that, if I deceive thee, thou shouldest slay me by a most pitiful death.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.80"/>Then wise Penelope answered her: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.81-23.82"/>Dear nurse, it is hard for thee to comprehend the counsels of the gods that are forever, how wise soever thou art. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.83-23.84"/>Nevertheless let us go to my son, that I may see the wooers dead and him that slew them.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.85"/>So saying, she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart pondered whether she should stand aloof and question her dear husband, or whether she should go up to him, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.85-23.87"/>But when she had come in and had passed over the stone threshold, she sat down opposite Odysseus in the light of the fire

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>
beside the further wall; but he was sitting by a tall pillar, looking down, and waiting to see whether his noble wife would say aught to him, when her eyes beheld him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.90-23.92"/>Howbeit she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul; and now with her eyes she would look full upon his face, and now again

<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>
she would fail to know him, for that he had upon him mean raiment. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.96"/>But Telemachus rebuked her, and spoke, and addressed her:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.97-23.99"/>My mother, cruel mother, that hast an unyielding heart, why dost thou thus hold aloof from my father, and dost not sit by his side and ask and question him?

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.100-23.102"/>No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband, who after many grievous toils had come back to her in the twentieth year to his native land: but thy heart is ever harder than stone.</q> 
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.103"/>Then wise Penelope answered him:

<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.105-23.107"/>My child, the heart in my breast is lost in wonder, and I have no power to speak at all, nor to ask a question, nor to look him in the face. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.107-23.109"/>But if in very truth he is Odysseus, and has come home, we two shall surely know one another more certainly;

<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>
for we have signs which we two alone know, signs hidden from others.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.111-23.112"/>So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus smiled, and straightway spoke to Telemachus winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.113-23.114"/>Telemachus, suffer now thy mother to test me in the halls; presently shall she win more certain knowledge.

<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.115-23.116"/>But now because I am foul, and am clad about my body in mean clothing, she scorns me, and will not yet admit that I am he. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.117"/>But for us, let us take thought how all may be the very best. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.118-23.120"/>For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even though it be a man that leaves not many behind to avenge him,

<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>
he goes into exile, and leaves his kindred and his native land; but we have slain those who were the very stay of the city, far the noblest of the youths of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.121-23.122"/>Of this I bid thee take thought.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.122"/>Then wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.123"/>Do thou thyself look to this, dear father; for thy

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.127-23.128"/>As for us, we will follow with thee eagerly, nor methinks shall we be wanting in valor, so far as we have strength.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>But let the divine minstrel with his clear-toned lyre in hand be our leader in the gladsome dance,

<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>
that any man who hears the sound from without, whether a passer-by or one of those who dwell around, may say that it is a wedding feast; and so the rumor of the slaying of the wooers shall not be spread abroad throughout the city before we go forth to our well-wooded farm. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.137-23.139"/>There

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
shall we afterwards devise whatever advantage the Olympian may vouchsafe us.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.141-23.143"/>So he spoke, and they all readily hearkened and obeyed. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.143-23.145"/>First they bathed and put on their tunics, and the women arrayed themselves, and the divine minstrel took the hollow lyre and aroused in them the desire

of sweet song and goodly dance. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.146-23.147"/>So the great hall resounded all about with the tread of dancing men and of fair-girdled women; and thus would one speak who heard the noise from without the house:

<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.150-23.151"/>Cruel she was, nor had she the heart to keep the great house of her wedded husband to the end, even till he should come.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.152"/>So they would say, but they knew not how these things were. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.153-23.155"/>Meanwhile the housewife Eurynome bathed the great-hearted Odysseus in his house, and anointed him with oil,

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>
and cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic; and over his head Athena shed abundant beauty, making him taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made locks to flow in curls like the hyacinth flower. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.156-23.157"/>And as when a man overlays silver with gold,

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace on his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like unto the immortals. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.162"/>Then he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
opposite his wife; and he spoke to her and said:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.166-23.167"/>Strange lady! to thee beyond all women have the dwellers on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> given a heart that cannot be softened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.172"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: <q>

nor yet am I too greatly amazed, but right well do I know what manner of man thou wast, when thou wentest forth from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> on thy long-oared ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:23.181-23.182"/>But Odysseus, in a burst of anger, spoke to his true-hearted wife, and said: <q>

leading down the spirits of the wooers slain by Odysseus; and the two, seized with wonder, went straight toward them when they beheld them.

<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.125"/>We wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone, and she neither refused the hateful marriage, nor would she ever make an end, devising for us death and black fate. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.126-24.128"/>Nay, she contrived in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—

<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>
fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.130"/>Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when

    <q><p>So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.138"/>Then day by day she would weave at the great web,

<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>
but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.141"/>Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned and many days were brought in their course, even then one of her women who knew all, told us,

<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>
and we caught her unravelling the splendid web. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.146"/>So she finished it against her will perforce.</p>
    <p>Now when she had shewn us the robe, after weaving the great web and washing it, and it shone like the sun or the moon, then it was that some cruel god brought Odysseus from somewhere

to the border of the land, where the swineherd dwelt. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.151-24.152"/>Thither too came the dear son of divine Odysseus on his return from sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> in his black ship, and these two, when they had planned an evil death for the wooers, came to the famous city, Odysseus verily

later, but Telemachus led the way before him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.156-24.158"/>Now the swineherd brought his master, clad in mean raiment, in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff, and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body; and not one of us could know that it was he,

<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>
when he appeared so suddenly, no, not even those that were older men, but we assailed him with evil words and with missiles. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.162-24.163"/>Howbeit he with steadfast heart endured for a time to be pelted and taunted in his own halls; but when at last the will of Zeus, who bears the aegis, roused him,

<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>
with the help of Telemachus he took all the beautiful arms and laid them away in the store-room and made fast the bolts. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Then in his great cunning he bade his wife set before the wooers his bow and the grey iron to be a contest for us ill-fated men and the beginning of death.

<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.170-24.171"/>And no man of us was able to stretch the string of the mighty bow; nay, we fell far short of that strength. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.172-24.174"/>But when the great bow came to the hands of Odysseus, then we all cried out aloud not to give him the bow, how much soever he might speak;

<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>
but Telemachus alone urged him on, and bade him take it. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.175"/>Then he took the bow in his hand, the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and with ease did he string it and send an arrow through the iron. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.176-24.179"/>Then he went and stood on the threshold, and poured out the swift arrows, glaring about him terribly, and smote king Antinous.

<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.180-24.181"/>And thereafter upon the others he with sure aim let fly his shafts, fraught with groanings, and the men fell thick and fast. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.181"/>Then was it known that some god was their helper; for straightway rushing on through the halls in their fury they slew men left and right, and therefrom rose hideous groaning,

<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>
as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.186-24.187"/>Thus we perished, Agamemnon, and even now our bodies still lie uncared-for in the halls of Odysseus; for our friends in each man's home know naught as yet—our friends who might wash the black blood from our wounds

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.190"/>Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.191"/>Happy son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, of a truth full of all excellence was the wife thou didst win, so good of understanding was peerless Penelope,

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.195-24.196"/>Therefore the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals shall make among men on earth a pleasant song in honor of constant Penelope. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.196-24.202"/>Not on this wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise evil deeds

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.203-24.204"/>Thus the two spoke to one another, as they stood in the house of Hades beneath the depths of the earth.
    

<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.205-24.207"/>But Odysseus and his men, when they had gone down from the city, quickly came to the fair and well-ordered farm of Laertes, which he had won for himself in days past, and much had he toiled for it.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.208-24.210"/>There was his house, and all about it ran the sheds in which ate, and sat, and slept

the servants that were bondsmen, that did his pleasure; but within it was an old Sicilian woman, who tended the old man with kindly care there at the farm, far from the city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.211-24.212"/>Then Odysseus spoke to the servants and to his son, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.213"/>Do you now go within the well-built house,

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>
and straightway slay for dinner the best of the swine; but I will make trial of my father, and see whether he will recognize me and know me by sight, or whether he will fail to know me, since I have been gone so long a time.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.216-24.218"/>So saying, he gave to the slaves his battle-gear.

<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.220-24.221"/>They thereafter went quickly to the house; but Odysseus drew near to the fruitful vineyard in his quest. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.222-24.223"/>Now he did not find Dolius as he went down into the great orchard, nor any of his slaves or of his sons, but as it chanced

they had gone to gather stones for the vineyard wall, and the old man was their leader. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.226-24.227"/>But he found his father alone in the well-ordered vineyard, digging about a plant; and he was clothed in a foul tunic, patched and wretched, and about his shins he had bound stitched greaves of ox-hide to guard against scratches,

<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>
and he wore gloves upon his hands because of the thorns, and on his head a goatskin cap; and he nursed his sorrow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.230-24.231"/>Now when the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus saw him, worn with old age and laden with great grief at heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree, and shed tears.

<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.235-24.238"/>Then he debated in mind and heart whether to kiss and embrace his father, and tell him all, how he had returned and come to his native land, or whether he should first question him, and prove him in each thing. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.239-24.240"/>And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course,

to prove him first with mocking words.

thou bearest woeful old age, and therewith art foul and unkempt, and clad in mean raiment. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.251-24.253"/>Surely it is not because of sloth on thy part that thy master cares not for thee, nor dost thou seem in any wise like a slave to look upon either in form or in stature; for thou art like a king, even like one who, when he has bathed and eaten,

<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>
should sleep soft; for this is the way of old men.

<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.265"/>For I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.266-24.268"/>I once entertained in my dear native land a man that came to our house, and never did any man beside of strangers that dwell afar come to my house a more welcome guest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.302"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.358"/>But let us go to the house, which lies near the orchard, for thither

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.361"/>I sent forward Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, that with all speed they might prepare our meal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.365-24.367"/>Meanwhile the Sicilian handmaid bathed great-hearted Laertes in his house, and anointed him with oil, and about him cast a fair cloak. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.367-24.369"/>But Athena drew near, and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people, and made him taller than before and mightier to behold.

<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.370"/>Then he came forth from the bath, and his dear son marvelled at him, seeing him in presence like unto the immortal gods. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.370-24.371"/>And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.372"/>Father, surely some one of the gods that are forever has made thee goodlier to behold in comeliness and in stature.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.375"/>Then wise Laertes answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.376-24.381"/>I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength as when I took Nericus, the well built citadel on the shore of the mainland, when I was lord of the Cephallenians, even in such strength I had stood by thy side yesterday in our house

<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>
with my armour about my shoulders, and had beaten back the wooers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.381-24.382"/>So should I have loosened the knees of many of them in the halls, and thy heart would have been made glad within thee.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.383"/>So they spoke to one another. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.384-24.385"/>But when the others had ceased from their labour, and had made ready the meal,

<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>
they sat down in order on the chairs and high seats. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.386-24.390"/>Then they were about to set hands to their food, when the old man Dolius drew near, and with him the old man's sons, wearied from their work in the fields, for their mother, the old Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she who

<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>
saw to their food, and tended the old man with kindly care, now that old age had laid hold of him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.391-24.392"/>And they, when they saw Odysseus, and marked him in their minds, stood in the halls lost in wonder. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.392-24.393"/>But Odysseus addressed them with gentle words, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.394"/>Old man, sit down to dinner, and do ye wholly forget your wonder,

<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>
for long have we waited in the halls, though eager to set hands to the food, ever expecting your coming.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.395-24.396"/>So he spoke, and Dolius ran straight toward him with both hands outstretched, and he clasped the hand of Odysseus and kissed it on the wrist, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
    

<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.400-24.402"/>Dear master, since thou hast come back to us, who sorely longed for thee, but had no more thought to see thee, and the gods themselves have brought thee—hail to thee, and all welcome, and may the gods grant thee happiness. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.403-24.405"/>And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Does wise Penelope yet know surely

that thou hast come back hither, or shall we send her a messenger?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.406-24.407"/>Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.407"/>Old man, she knows already; why shouldst thou be busied with this?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.408"/>So he spoke, and the other sat down again on the polished chair. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.409-24.411"/>And even in like manner the sons of Dolius gathered around glorious Odysseus

<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>
and greeted him in speech, and clasped his hands. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.412"/>Then they sat down in order beside Dolius, their father.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.413-24.414"/>So they were busied with their meal in the halls; but meanwhile Rumor, the messenger, went swiftly throughout all the city, telling of the terrible death and fate of the wooers.

<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.415-24.419"/>And the people heard it all at once, and gathered from every side with moanings and wailings before the palace of Odysseus. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>Forth from the halls they brought each his dead, and buried them; and those from other cities they sent each to his own home, placing them on swift ships for seamen to bear them,

<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>
but they themselves went together to the place of assembly, sad at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.420"/>Now when they were assembled and met together Eupeithes arose and spoke among them, for comfortless grief for his son lay heavy on his heart, even for Antinous, the first man whom goodly Odysseus had slain.

<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.425"/>Weeping for him he addressed their assembly and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.426"/>Friends, a monstrous deed has this man of a truth devised against the Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.427-24.428"/>Some he led forth in his ships, many men and goodly, and he has lost his hollow ships and utterly lost his men; and others again has he slain on his return, and these by far the best of the Cephallenians.

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.432"/>Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to <placeName key="tgn,7011036">Pylos</placeName> or to goodly <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.433-24.435"/>For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not

<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>
take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.435-24.436"/>To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.437"/>Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.438"/>So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.439-24.441"/>Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel

<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>
from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, and wonder seized every man. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.441"/>Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.442"/>Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.

<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.445-24.446"/>Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.447-24.449"/>Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; and they fell thick and fast.</q></p>

<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.450"/>So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.451-24.452"/>Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after: he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.452"/>Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say.

<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.455"/>Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.456-24.460"/>They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife

<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>
of a prince, who, they said, would never more return. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.460"/>Now then be it thus; and do you hearken to me, as I bid. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.461"/>Let us not go forth, lest haply many a one shall find a bane which he has brought upon himself.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.461"/>So he spoke, but they sprang up with loud cries, more than half of them, but the rest remained together in their seats;

<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>
for his speech was not to their mind, but they hearkened to Eupeithes, and quickly thereafter they rushed for their arms. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.465-24.466"/>Then when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they gathered together in front of the spacious city. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.466"/>And Eupeithes led them in his folly,

<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>
for he thought to avenge the slaying of his son; yet he was himself never more to come back, but was there to meet his doom.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.470-24.471"/>But Athena spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, saying: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.472"/>Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, tell to me that ask thee what purpose thy mind now hides within thee.

<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.475-24.476"/>Wilt thou yet further bring to pass evil war and the dread din of battle, or wilt thou establish friendship betwixt the twain?</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.477"/>Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.478"/>My child, why dost thou ask and question me of this? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.479-24.480"/>Didst thou not thyself devise this plan,

<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>
that verily Odysseus should take vengeance on these men at his coming? 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.481"/>Do as thou wilt, but I will tell thee what is fitting. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.481"/>Now that goodly Odysseus has taken vengeance on the wooers, let them swear a solemn oath, and let him be king all his days, and let us on our part

<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>
bring about a forgetting of the slaying of their sons and brothers; and let them love one another as before, and let wealth and peace abound.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.485-24.486"/>So saying, he roused Athena, who was already eager, and she went darting down from the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.487-24.488"/>But when they had put from them the desire of honey-hearted food,

<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>
the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was the first to speak among his company, saying: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.491"/>Let one go forth and see whether they be not now drawing near.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.492"/>So he spoke, and a son of Dolius went forth, as he bade; he went and stood upon the threshold, and saw them all close at hand, and straightway he spoke to Odysseus winged words:

<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>
<q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.495"/>Here they are close at hand. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.495"/>Quick, let us arm.</q></p>

                        <p>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.496-24.497"/>So he spoke, and they rose up and arrayed themselves in armour: Odysseus and his men were four, and six the sons of Dolius, and among them Laertes and Dolius donned their armour, grey-headed though they were, warriors perforce.

<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.500-24.501"/>But when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they opened the doors and went forth, and Odysseus led them.
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.502-24.503"/>Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad at sight of her,

<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>
and straightway spoke to Telemachus, his dear son:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.505"/>Telemachus, now shalt thou learn this—having thyself come to the place of battle, where the best warriors are put to the trial—to bring no disgrace upon the house of thy fathers, for we have ever excelled in strength and in valor over all the earth.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.510"/>And wise Telemachus answered him: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.511-24.512"/>Thou shalt see me, if thou wilt, dear father, in my present temper, bringing no disgrace upon thy house, even as thou sayest.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.513"/>So said he, and Laertes was glad, and spoke, saying: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.514"/>What a day is this for me, kind gods!

<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.515"/>Verily right glad am I: my son and my son's son are vying with one another in valor.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.516"/>Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said: <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.517-24.519"/>Son of Arceisius, far the dearest of all my friends, make a prayer to the flashing-eyed maiden and to father Zeus, and then straightway raise aloft thy long spear, and hurl it.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.520-24.523"/>So spoke Pallas Athena, and breathed into him great might. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.524-24.525"/>Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:nomatch"/>This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through,

<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>
and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.526-24.527"/>Then on the foremost fighters fell Odysseus and his glorious son, and thrust at them with swords and double-pointed spears. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.528-24.530"/>And now would they have slain them all, and cut them off from returning, had not Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis,

<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>
shouted aloud, and checked all the host, saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.531-24.532"/>Refrain, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, from grievous war, that with all speed you may part, and that without bloodshed.</q>
    

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.533"/>So spoke Athena, and pale fear seized them. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.534-24.535"/>Then in their terror the arms flew from their hands

<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>
and fell one and all to the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice, and they turned toward the city, eager to save their lives. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.536"/>Terribly then shouted the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and gathering himself together he swooped upon them like an eagle of lofty flight, and at that moment the son of Cronos cast a flaming thunderbolt,

<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>
and down it fell before the flashing-eyed daughter of the mighty sire. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.541"/>Then flashing-eyed Athena spoke to Odysseus saying:
    <q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.542-24.544"/>Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, stay thy hand, and make the strife of equal<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1</note> war to cease, lest haply the son of Cronos be wroth with thee, even Zeus, whose voice is borne afar.</q>
    

<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>


<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.545"/>So spoke Athena, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart. 

<milestone unit="sentence" n="check:24.546-24.548"/>Then for all time to come a solemn covenant betwixt the twain was made by Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice.</p>
