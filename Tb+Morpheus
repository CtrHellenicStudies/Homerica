#Integrating Treebank data  with rich Morpheus output


Support for those learning ancient Greek provided the impulse for this work. The Treebanks
provide information about the part of speech and morphological analysis for individual forms,
but the Treebank does not record the paradigm that particular forms follow. Thus the forms μῆνιν ("wrath")
and νοῦσον ("disease") are
both the same part of speech tag in the treebank (postag="n-s---fa-") because each is a feminine singular
accusative noun, listed under the dictionary headwords μῆνις and νοῦσος (the nominative singular
forms).

From the standpoint of someone learning Greek, however, the two words are very different. The word
μῆνις uses different endings than does νοῦσος (they are, respectively,
 so-called third and first declension nouns). Greek morphology is much more complex than
 English, French, German or Italian. Developing an ability to recognize the
 different morphological patterns is a major task for the learning.

When students learn a paradigm, we want them to be able to do the following:

* Learn the precise frequency with which that paradigm will appear in the corpus that they wish to master.
(For the purposes of this document, we will assume that the corpus consists of the Iliad and
Odyssey, but that is an opportunistic starting point that leverages the many resources --
such as the Treebanks for the Iliad and Odyssey -- that already exist.)

* See visualizations that allow them to see where that paradigm appears in the corpus of interest.

* Examine passages where those paradigms appear, both the treebank and translations aligned at the
word and phrase level allowing them to look at the Greek from the first class.

* Understand how often particular endings reappear in other paradigms -- the endings of them
three declensions are reused over and over again. Learners should recognize the
multiplier effect of mastering the core elements of the language.

* Be able to practice what they have learned both with vocabulary that they have
encountered in their formal classes and with unseen vocabulary from the corpus of
interest.


In its verbose mode (`cruncher -d`), Morpheus outputs information
such as the following.

The output the Iliad and the Odyssey is in the file `homer-lmorph.txt`.

The Beta Code transliteration is not as attractive for most readers as modern unicode
and creating a unicode version of this data is an important task. Still
Beta Code offers at least two advantages.

* It is transparent. There are different ways of representing Greek accents
in the file that look the same to the user. This can cause great confusion (e.g., failed
searches because the query and the file to be searched use different encodings.)

* It is expressive. There are some combinations of accents and long/short markers
that cannot be easily entered on a keyboard in unicode.

We are developing a simplified version of the above, one suited for exchange as
a CSV file.

The full output is in the file `homer-morphu.txt`.

The line above includes the following fields:

1. The raw word as it appears in the text. This is particularly important when we have ellipsis,
e.g., the text has a form such as ἐπέμπετ᾽, which could stand for ἐπέμπετε ("you [pl] were sending") or ἐπέμπετο ("s/he was being sent").

2. The working model of the word. In most cases, the raw and work word are identical. In the case above, we
would test both ἐπέμπετε and ἐπέμπετο.

3. The dictionary word (lemma) associated with this analysis.

4. The word segmented into various components.

5. The stem type defining the paradigm from which this analysis was derived.
The key `ew_pr` indicates that this form belongs to the epsilon contract variation
on the present stem.

* In addition, the example above includes information about derivational
morphology. The present stem was derived from the fact that this verb is an
epsilon-contract verb from which all six principal parts can be automatically
generated.

6. The morphological analysis.

7. [not featured in the above example] Additional keys derived From
analysis of the form.

8. [not yet implemented] Information about the dialect(s) to which the form
might belong. This is problematic. We can use dialectical information to
filter out analyses (e.g., strictly Doric forms would not appear in
Attic prose) but the dialects reflect comments in print lexica and grammars
that have been incorporated in Morpheus. We should we rederive our models
of dialectical features by developing curated corpora.
